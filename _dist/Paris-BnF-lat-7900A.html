    <h1>Paris BnF, lat 7900A</h1>
    <p><strong>Paris, BnF, Latin 7900A</strong></p><p>Date: end of the 9th or beginning of the 10th century</p><p>Place of origin: Northern Italy, perhaps Milan</p><p>Parchment manuscript, 155 folia, 340 x 270 mm, Carolingian minuscule, Latin.</p><p>Contents: The manuscript consists of four parts: </p><p>I the <em>Six Comedies</em> of Publius Terentius Afer on f. 1r-26v;</p><p>II works of Q. Horatius Flaccus on f. 27r-56v;</p><p>III Lucan’s <em>Pharsalia</em> and Juvenal’s <em>Satyres</em> on f. 57r-111v;</p><p>IV  Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</em> with the large commentary tradition attributed to Remigius of Auxerre on f. 112r-155v.</p><p>Special features: All the texts assembled in this codex are provided with ample commentary, roughly contemporary with the main text. Martianus’s <em>De nuptiis</em> has a particularly rich commentary: the tradition attributed to Remigius, who compiled many commentaries by collecting and collating earlier traditions and merging them into a new one. The pages are filled to the brim with text [see glosses and commentaries]. The liberal arts are illustrated at the beginning of each chapter with pen drawings.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/7900Acover.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="images/content/7900Acover2.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Martianus Capella and his allegorical encyclopaedia</strong></p><p>Martianus Capella is an author from Carthago, North Arfica, in the 5th century, a province of the Roman empire until the Vandals took over in 439 AD. Only one of his works survived: a work titled <em>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</em>, “About the marriage of Philology and Mercury”. In this work, the story is told about the god Mercury marrying the earthly maiden Philology, a personification of earthly knowledge and science. In this allegory, Mercury stands for the body of knowledge connected to <em>language</em>, or the <em>trivium</em>, Philology for the body of knowledge connected to <em>number</em>, or the <em>quadrivium</em>. Together, the couple personifies perfect knowledge. In the story, the couple receives a curious gift from the gods to celebrate their marriage: seven maidens come to present their knowledge at the banquet. The maidens are personifications of the seven Liberal Arts, the arts of the trivium and of the quadrivium. Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic are the three arts of language, Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy and Music are the four arts of number. For this exhibition, the author Martianus is crucial because he is one of the most important medieval sources for the establishment of the curriculum of the Seven Liberal Arts. Furthermore, especially his treatment of the art of Dialectic was elaborately commented upon.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/ladydialectica2.jpg"><figcaption>Personification of the art of Dialectic in the west façade, Chartres Cathedral, France.<br>Source: rechten?</figcaption></figure></p><p>Here you see the opening of Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis</em> on f. 112r. </p><p><figure><img src="images/content/7900Af112r.jpg"><figcaption>Paris BnF lat.7900A f.112r<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p><p>Nota bene: the main text of Martianus Capella occupies the small column on the left. Its beginning is missing because the page is damaged. Perhaps the text started with a decorated initial that was cut out by a later dealer in manuscripts or manuscript’s pages. The wide column on the right is the commentary of Remigius. The commentary has become a solid block of text instead of a series of notes spread in the margin.</p><p>Here (f. 116r-v) you can see that the parchment used for this manuscript was not of the best quality: the natural edges of the skin are visible as the edges of the page. From the fact that the text carefully follows the edge of the page we can conclude that the page was not damaged, but that an ‘incomplete’ page was used in the quire.</p><p>[[[7900A116r.jpg]]] [[[7900A116v.jpg]]]</p><p>Decorated initials in animal style (f. 120v) mark the beginning of a new book, both for the main text (narrow column on the right) and for the commentary (wide column on the left).</p><p>[[[7900Af120v.jpg]]]</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/7900A127v.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, Lat. 7900A f.127v: ‘Lady Grammar’ teaches a group of students.

A dragon bearing a remarkably strong resemblance to a crocodile is tickled with a spear!</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/7900Af128r.jpg"><figcaption>Paris BnF lat.7900A f.128r<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p><p>Another one of these fanciful initials, this time an E made with two peacocks, is used to mark the beginning of a new section in Juvenal’s <em>Satyres</em> on f. 109v. </p><p>[[[7900A109v.jpg]]]</p><p>On f. 132v a full page illustration marks the beginning of book IV, on Dialectica.  Two students tentatively approach Lady Dialectica, who is armed with a hook (to reel people in) and has snakes coming out of her sleeve (with which she attacks her opponents)! She is a dangerous lady.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/7900A132v.jpg"><figcaption>Lady Dialectica<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src="images/content/7900Af140v.jpg"><figcaption>Portrait of Lady Rhetoric on f.140v<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="images/content/7900Af151v.jpg"><figcaption>Portrait of Lady Astronomy on f.151v<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="images/content/7900Af153v.jpg"><figcaption>The art of music is illustrated on f. 153v<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p>  </div>
