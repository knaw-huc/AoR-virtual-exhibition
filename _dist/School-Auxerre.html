      <p><strong>Auxerre in the Carolingian period</strong></p><p>The monastery of St. Germain at Auxerre was founded in the 5th century, and had an important and influential school in the Carolingian period. Some of its masters were Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre, both known for their copious production of commentaries or gloss-collections. </p><p>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Saint-Germain_d%27Auxerre</p><p>L’école carolingienne d’Auxerre: de Murethach à Remi 830-908, ed. D. Iogna-Prat, C. Jeudy, G. Lobrichon, Paris: Beauchesne, 1991)</p><p><strong>Heiric of Auxerre (841-876)</strong></p><p>Heiric was a member of the monastic community at Auxerre from a child’s age on. He himself had had a famous master: Lupus of Ferrières (c. 805-c. 862), a scholar at the court of Charles the Bald. In the chain of teachers, we can place him in an impressive chain:</p><p>Alcuin taught (a.o.)</p><p>- Hrabanus Maurus, who taught (o.a.)</p><p>     - Lupus of Ferrières, who taught (o.a.)</p><p>          - Heiric of Auxerre, who taught (o.a.)</p><p>               - Remigius of Auxerre</p><p>Heiric of Auxerre was also taught by Haymo of Auxerre, who was taught by Murethach.</p><p>Remigius of Auxerre was the teacher of Odo of Cluny and others.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/hrabanus.jpg"><figcaption>Hrabanus (left) and Alcuin (middle) dedicate a work to Archbishop Otgar of Mainz (Right)<br>Source: Vienna, ÖnB, cod.652, fol. 2v (Fulda, 2nd quarter of the 9th century)</figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Teachers in manuscripts</strong></p><p>The art of reasoning was taught in schools at monasteries, cathedrals and universities, by teachers and for students. Traces in medieval manuscripts show the practices of education in multiple ways.</p><figure class="aorCompManuscript">

<p>In many manuscripts we find glosses and notes in the margin. They reflect the way in which a text was used by the teacher in the classroom. </p><p>Meet Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949, where glosses are ascribed to a certain master: Heiric of Auxerre</p><figure class="aorCompManuscript">

<p>This is a manuscript with a set of texts on logic. On this opening page, f. 1r, the Latin translation of Aristotle’s On Interpretation start: INCIPIUNT PERIERMENIAE ARISTOTELIS. In the margins and in between the lines, many notes have been added, even across the page.</p><p>±p±4±p±</p><p>Here, on f. 24r, we see a text which is even more heavily glossed: the whole space around the text is filled with comments. It is the Latin translation of Aristotle’s Categories. </p><figure class="aorCompManuscript">

<p>Here on f. 25v a title has been added to the notes: ‘Heiricus magister Remigii fecit has glossas’, ‘Heiric, the master of Remigius, made these glosses’.It is a rare piece of evidence: authors of glosses are seldom identified.</p><p>±p±57±p±</p><p><strong>Remigius of Auxerre: champion of commentaries?</strong></p><p>Remigius, the last of the great teachers of Auxerre, has been credited with the composition of around 20 commentaries! It is a matter of debate whether he actually authored all these commentaries, compiled them from existing commentary traditions, or had them compiled by students and scholars in his school.</p><p>Meet Paris, BnF, lat. 7900A:</p><p>Here we see his commentary on Dialectic from Martianus Capella. The main text is in the small column on the left, the commentary is in the wide column on the left!</p><p>±p±56±p±</p></div></div>
