    <h1>Alcuin and dialogue</h1>
    <p><strong>Alcuin and Dialogue</strong></p><p>Dialogue was a powerful tool in teaching, as Plato already showed in the dialogues of Socrates and his students: a student could ask his teacher questions, and thus learn from the master’s knowledge, or the teacher could ask his student questions, and thus check whether he had learned properly about the topics at hand.</p><p>Alcuin (735−804), the great scholar at the court of Charlemagne (742-814), very much identified as a teacher in his works. He wrote his introduction to the Art of Reasoning as a dialogue between himself and Charlemagne, with Charlemagne asking questions and Alcuin answering.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/alcuin.jpg"><figcaption>Portrait of Alcuin<br>Source: Bayerische Staatsbibliothek</figcaption></figure></p><p>Meet Leiden, UB, BPL 84 (link), which contains, among other things, Alcuin’s Dialogue on Dialectica</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/84cover.jpg"><figcaption>Leiden UB BPL 84<br>Source: eigen foto</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src="images/content/84f90r.jpg"><figcaption>Dialogue between Alcuin and Charlemagne<br>Source: eigen foto</figcaption></figure></p><p>Fol 90r: INCIPIT ARS DIALECTICA ALCHOINI PHILOSOPHI. AD KAROLUM MAGNUM; “The Art of reasoning of Alcuin the Philosopher for Charlemagne begins.”</p><p>Questions from Charlemagne are marked with K (Karolus), answers from Alcuin with A (Alcuin).</p><p>Here you can see how Alcuin patiently explains the art of dialectic, its terminology, its components and what you can do with it. He illustrates with examples to make the dry text more lively.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/84fonbekend1.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: eigen foto</figcaption></figure></p><p>Ch: How many species are there in dialectic?</p><p>A: The most important are 5: ‘isagogae’, categories, syllogistic formulas and definitions, ‘topica’, and ‘perermeniae’.</p><p>Ch: What are ‘isagogae’?</p><p>A: Isagoge is the (Greek) word for Latin ‘introductio’, ‘introduction’.</p><p>Ch: What does ‘introduction’ mean?</p><p>A: Introduction is …</p><p>[[[84onbekend2.jpg]]]</p><p>Ch: What is ‘genus’?</p><p>A: ‘Genus’ is what can be divided into species: it describes whatever you are investigating in an inclusive word, such as ‘animal’. For each individual species  - man, horse, ox, lion etc. – ‘animal’ is the genus and is applied to them all.</p><p>Ch: What is ‘species’?</p><p>A: ‘Species’ is …</p><p>(Translation: M.
