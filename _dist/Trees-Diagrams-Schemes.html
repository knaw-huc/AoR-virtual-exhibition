The remaining categories are ‘accidents’, these are the properties of the substance, they describe <em>how </em>something is, properties which are not necessarily essential to <em>what</em> it is (e.g. ‘Socrates is sitting’; Socrates could equally be standing, but he would still be Socrates).</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Porphyry, a third-century Greek philosopher, wrote an important work called the <em>Isagoge</em>, which was an introduction to Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em>.

Porphyry investigated what substance consisted of by using *<em>differentiae</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> – looking at the essential features which distinguish one *<em>species</em> within a *<em>genus</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> from another. This process of distinguishing between genera was often visualised in medieval manuscripts in the form of a tree diagram.<br /></p><p>Porphyry identifies five ‘predicables’, genus, species, differentiae, property and accident.

Note – in this case the tree is worked out to a particular conclusion – to identify the characteristics of the human species. A human (with particular examples given here as Socrates, Plato, Cicero) is mortal, rational, sensitive, animate, corporeal and made of substance. But the scheme also identifies other genera which describe the living world. For example, a sensitive, animate, corporeal substance is, in other words, an animal, while an insensitive, animate, corporeal substance, is a plant.</p><p>It’s important to note that all of Aristotle’s categories could be expanded into ‘trees’ using the process of differentiation, but the category of substance was the one which was most commonly executed.</p><h2>±col2span±</h2><p>±f±bnf165_37_r±f±<br />±row±</p><div class="aoCol1"><p>The ‘Porphyrian tree’ was co-opted into different textual contexts. For example, in this example, a version of the Porphyrian tree is incorporated into a thirteenth-century manuscript of John of Damascus’ <em>Logica </em>(BnF lat. 16598, f. 37r). This manuscript was donated to the library at the Sorbonne by Gerard d’Abbeville [[[Abbeville.docx]]], a thirteenth-century master. Here, as might befit a book belonging to a theologian, Peter and Paul substitute for Plato and Socrates as examples of the species ‘man’.</p><h2>±col2span±</h2><p>±f±bnf770_52_r±f± </p><p><br /></h2></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2><em>Usia</em> [substance, a Latin form of the Greek οὐσία]<br />Animal / Genus<br />Homo / Species<br />Cicero / <em>Estheti</em> [to feel?]</h2><p>The tradition of referring to the ’Porphyrian tree’ as a tree can be traced back to the thirteenth century. The famous logical text book, <em>Summulae logicales</em> by Peter of Spain described ‘<em>arbor Porphyriana’ </em>and copies of the text were frequently illustrated with depictions of the Porphyrian tree as a tree – complete with leaves and branches. Like <strong>BnF lat. 16598</strong>, this manuscript was also part of the bequest of <strong>Gerard d’Abbeville </strong>to the library of the Sorbonne in the thirteenth century.</p><p>±col2span±<br />±f±bnf166_8_v±f±</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2><strong>Other ways of using schemes to think about the nature of being<br /></strong>The Porphyrian tree was just one example of how medieval scholars grappled with thinking about the nature of being.</h2><h2>±col2span±<br />±f±bpl88_62_r±f± </h2><h2></h2><p>In these two copies of Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis…</em> [<strong>link to Mariken] </strong>a small marginal diagram is appended to the section on dialectic.

He is also ‘<em>bonitas</em>’, ‘goodness’ and <em>‘elementa</em>’, ‘element’ (here in the sense of an ultimate substance)</p><p>The horizontal branches relate these qualities to his capacities (as expressed in the syllogistic statements at the top of the page – see Mariken), differentiating his qualities from other beings.</p><p>DRAFT: TO BE DEVELOPED</p><p><a id="_headingh.gjdgxs"></a>I want to add something in on discovering arguments through using the differentiae used by Boethius in <em>De differentiis topicis</em> – using BnF lat. 6400g <strong>LINK </strong>– which we can tie back into BPL 88 <strong>LINK </strong>as bawdiness in classroom.
