    <h2>The dark ages</h2><p>The "Dark Ages" is a historical periodization traditionally referring to the Middle Ages, that asserts that a demographic, cultural, and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire.</p><p>The term employs traditional light-versus-darkness imagery to contrast the era's "darkness" (lack of records) with earlier and later periods of "light" (abundance of records).[3] The concept of a "Dark Age" originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch, who regarded the post-Roman centuries as "dark" compared to the light of classical antiquity.[3][4] The phrase "Dark Age" itself derives from the Latin saeculum obscurum, originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries.[5] The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance; this became especially popular during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment.</p><h2>Alcuin</h2><p>Alcuin (735âˆ’804), the great scholar at the court of Charlemagne (742-814), very much identified as a teacher in his works. He wrote his introduction to the Art of Reasoning as a dialogue, between himself and Charlemagne, with Charlemagne asking questions and Alcuin answering.</p>  </div>
