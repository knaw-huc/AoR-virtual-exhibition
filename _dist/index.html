    <p>The Art of Reasoning in Medieval Manuscripts</p><p>Welcome to this online exhibition!</p><p>Topic: The art of reasoning in medieval times, as illustrated by manuscripts, texts and topics of debate.</p><p>Trailer</p><p>During the entire middle ages, the language of learning and scholarship was predominantly Latin, and the setting in which education took place was predominantly religious. Monasteries and cathedrals were the places where schools were set up, and universities were institutes founded by the church.</p><p>In the modern perception of the history of science and learning, the church is often depicted as a conservative power, trying to stop scientific progress. The middle ages are a dark period, in which no real thinking or progress could take place, because of the monopoly and control of the catholic church. Think of the churches’ ban on certain books of Aristotle, or the famous trial of the inquisition against Galileo Galilei’s work presenting proof of a heliocentric universe.</p><p>[[[test.jpg]]]</p><p>If one looks at the great production of books and texts in the Middle Ages, however, a completely different picture can also be drawn: from Late Antiquity on, the church promoted a culture of reading and studying. In monasteries, monks were put to work to copy texts, to read them and to work with them. In universities, the art of reading and discussing texts was perfected into a proper method of learning and examinations, which are still visible in the universities, their curriculum and their graduating systems of today.</p>  </div>
