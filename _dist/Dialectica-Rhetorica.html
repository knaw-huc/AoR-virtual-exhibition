    <h1>Dialectica and Rhetorica</h1>
    <p><strong>Dialectica and rhetorica:</strong></p><p><strong>The art of speaking and reasoning well</strong></p><p>After a pupil had learnt how to read and write in Latin (grammatica), it was time for a next level knowledge of the language: learning how to speak well and effectively (rhetorica) and how to build arguments and reason about knowledge (dialectica). These skills were needed for many purposes: to speak well is an art needed to get your message across and to convince people, to be able to argue is important for a proper understanding of texts, for using them in debates and for deciding in cases of disagreement. Dialectica became a crucial element in theological debate (link to orange theme ‘debates’).</p><p><strong>Rhetorica</strong></p><p>Cicero’s De Inventione and the Rhetorica ad Herennium (unknown author but generally attributed to Cicero during the Middle Ages) are key to the study of rhetoric and the inheritance of the classical tradition of argumentation. De Inventione was the most important book that was used in schools to teach rhetoric up until the 12th century. Later de Rhetorica ad Herennium took over this reputation. </p><p>Meet Leiden UB, GRO 22</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/22cover.jpg"><figcaption>Leiden UB GRO 22<br>Source: Universiteits Bibliotheek Leiden</figcaption></figure></p><p>Twelfth century MS of Cicero’s De inventione/Rhetorica ad Herennium, with annotations dating from the thirteenth to fifteenth century, i.e. this is a manuscript that has been in continuous use for an extensive period of time</p><p>Meet Deventer AB, 101 F 22 KL and Deventer AB, 101 F 23 KL</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/101F22cover.jpg"><figcaption>Deventer AB 101 F 22 KL<br>Source: Athenaeumbibliotheek</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src="images/content/101F23cover.jpg"><figcaption>Deventer AB 101 F 23 KL<br>Source: Athenaeumbibliotheek</figcaption></figure></p><p>Two twelfth-century manuscripts which were originally one, containing Cicero’s De inventione and the pseudo-Ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium.</p><p><strong>Leiden UB, GRO 22</strong></p><p><figure><img src="images/content/22f11r.jpg"><figcaption>Scheme in Leiden UB GRO 22, f.11r<br>Source: Universiteits Bibliotheek Leiden</figcaption></figure></p><p>Extracting the information provided in the text and arranging it in the form of a diagram or schemes helped the reader to understand and recollect what the author had written.

Stephen”</p><p>More explanation</p><p><strong>From Dialogue to Disputation</strong></p><p>From ancient times on, dialogues (between teachers and pupils) were an important instrument to teach the art of reasoning, to sharpen one’s thinking and training one’s skills of speech (link to Alcuin and dialogue).</p><p>In the period of the universities, a specific form of dialogue developed as a teaching tool, with set rules for how to play the game: the disputatio. It became the most important examination in the medieval university, and we still have a remnant of it today in the form of the public defence of dissertations.</p><p>[[[275f183r.jpg]]]</p><p>A personification of the liberal art of logic, holds a branch which flowers into the ‘syllogism’, a cornerstone of Aristotelian logic. The figures on the right – teacher and pupil – while embedded within the opening initial to a text, are depicted without books and in conversation. This scene, heavy with gestural components, conveys a sense of the orality of medieval teaching.</p><p><strong>The Art of Arguing: Dialectical Disputation</strong></p><p>Step 1: A problem is presented, posed as a yes or no question</p><p>Step 2: The questioner and the answerer pick a different side and present this as their thesis</p><p>Step 3: The questioner asks the answerer questions, posed as premises, which the answerer has to accept or deny. The questioner tries to trick the answerer in agreeing to certain premises that force him to compel his thesis.</p><p>Step 4: the dialectical disputation ends when 1. the answerer is forced to compel his thesis, 2. the answerer destroys the questioners premise by pointing to a fallacy or 3. when the time is up (HORA EST!)</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/debate.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: undefined</figcaption></figure></p><p>Something about dialectic as a violent art?</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/92f6v.jpg"><figcaption>Aristotle's army<br>Source: Badische Landesbibliothek</figcaption></figure></p><p>Het leger van Aristoteles valt de toren van de</p><p>onwaarheid (falsitas) aan. </p><p>Ook een vorm van het verchristelijken van de heidense literatuur (kruis met Jezus, bisschop..) </p><p><strong>Lady Grammar and Lady Dialectic</strong></p><p><figure><img src="images/content/348f128r.jpg"><figcaption>Lady Grammar<br>Source: The Britisch Library</figcaption></figure></p><p>This figure is a personification of the art of Grammar, drawing on the iconographic tradition of the fifth-century writer Martianus Capella, who described Grammar in On the Marriage of Mercury and Philology (link) as a woman who bears a ‘pruning knife with a sharp point with which she could prune the faults of pronunciation in children’</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/348f123v.jpg"><figcaption>Lady Dialectica<br>Source: The Britisch Library</figcaption></figure></p><p>On f. 123v (which discusses dialectic) we also find Lady Dialectica holding a hooked rod, with a snake clearly visible over her shoulder.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/7900A132v.jpg"><figcaption>Lady Dialectica<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p><p>Martianus Capella (fifth century) pictured his Lady Dialectica as a bellicose woman who drew people near with attractive propositions, but hid a nasty hook and vicious snakes up her sleeve to attack (and kill) her opponents in a disputation</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/ladydialectica.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: undefined</figcaption></figure></p><p>A miniature of the Liberal Arts from the Hortus deliciarum of Herrad of Landsberg (d. 1195)/Lady Dialectica is dressed elegantly in courtly fashion, wearing a yellow hood and a green gown with enormous sleeves, her right hand pointing, her left hand holding a dog's head (caput canis) with bared teeth.
