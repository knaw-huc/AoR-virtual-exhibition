      <p><strong>John the Scot and his assistant</strong></p><p>John ‘the Scot Eriugena’ (c.815-c.877)  was a peculiar figure in ninth-century intellectual life. It is not sure whether he was a monk, and he was certainly not an abbot or bishop. He was educated in Ireland and came to the court of Charles the Bald around 845 as head of his Palace School, just as Alcuin <a href="Alcuin-dialogue.html">Alcuin and dialogue</a> had been in the time of Charlemagne.</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/scottus.jpg"><figcaption>Imaginary portrait of Johannes Scottus (left) in Honorius of Autun’s Clavis physicae: Paris, BnF, lat. 6734, fol. 3r<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p><p>John the Scot is most known for his work Periphyseon (On the Division of Nature): a dialogue <a href="Alcuin-dialogue.html">Alcuin and dialogue</a> between a master and a pupil about the four divisions of nature: that which creates and is not created; that is created and creates; that which is created and does not create; that which is neither created nor creates. The method of reasoning is the syllogism <a href="syllogism.html">How to make sense with Syllogism</a>  </p><p>Here we see the model simplified and captured in opposites (contrariae) by Honorius of Autun in the 12th century, in his Clavis physicae. The following illustration gives an even clearer picture of how to understand this ‘created but not creating nature’ (i.e. angels, heavens, elements such as water, fire, air and earth) or ‘created ánd creating nature’ (i.e. birds and fish, people and plants)</p><figure class="aorCompManuscript">

<p><strong>John the Scot the scholar and his assistent ‘Nisifortinus</strong></p><p>John Scottus had a great interest in anything Greek. In manuscripts we recognize his presence by notes annotating and translating Greek passages.</p><p>[[[scottusonbekend.jpg]]]</p><p>John the Scot’s hand in manuscripts is often accompanied by a second hand, similar but not quite the same. It has been argued that this hand in the hand of his close assistant (Dutton &amp; Jeaneau), who worked for him and with him. We know him by the nickname of Nisifortinus, ‘But perhaps’… Whereas John was not afraid to take bold and controversial positions, his assistant worked hard to soften his statements and make them acceptable.	</p><p>This is a cartoon made by Randall Rosenfeld, which illustrates an anecdote reported (and invented?) by William of Malmesbury (†1143). King Charles the Bald and John the Scot (Eriugena) were seated at the same table, and the King said: “What separates a Sot from a Scot?” To which John answered: “Only a table.” And ‘Nisifortinus’ softens the insult with: “Unless, perhaps, anyone shall say that...”</p><p><figure><img src="images/content/cartoonrosenfeld.jpg"><figcaption>This is a cartoon made by Randall Rosenfeld, which illustrates an anecdote reported (and invented?) by William of Malmesbury (†1143).
