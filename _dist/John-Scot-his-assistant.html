      <div class="aoCol1"><h2>John ‘the Scot Eriugena’</h2><p>John ‘the Scot Eriugena’ (c.815-c.877)  was a peculiar figure in ninth-century intellectual life. It is not sure whether he was a monk, and he was certainly not an abbot or bishop. He was educated in Ireland and came to the court of Charles the Bald around 845 as head of his Palace School, just as Alcuin <a href="Alcuin-dialogue.html">Alcuin and dialogue</a> had been in the time of Charlemagne.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/scottus.jpg"><figcaption>Imaginary portrait of Johannes Scottus (on the right) in Honorius of Autun’s Clavis physicae: Paris, BnF, lat. 6734, fol. 3r. John the Scot engages in a discussion with ‘Abbot Theodorus’ about his theological treatise on the creation of the world, the Periphyseon. Theodorus holds a banner with the text: “he reveals the light of dogma by the sharpness of his mind”, and John Scottus holds a banner saying: “He seeks to make hidden things clarify themselves.”<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>John the Scot is most known for his work Periphyseon (On the Division of Nature): a dialogue <a href="Alcuin-dialogue.html">Alcuin and dialogue</a> between a master and a pupil about the four divisions of nature: that which creates and is not created; that is created and creates; that which is created and does not create; that which is neither created nor creates.

In manuscripts we recognize his presence by notes annotating and translating Greek passages. Here we see an annotation in the lower margin written by John Scottus himself (we know his autograph): he adds a Greek passage from Homerus’ Odysseus and adds a latin translation above the Greek words. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/bpl67f32v.jpg"><figcaption>Leiden, UB, BPL 67, f. 32v.<br>Source: Universiteitsbibliotheek Leiden</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>John the Scot’s hand in manuscripts is often accompanied by a second hand, similar but not quite the same.

The philosophical language of John Scottus and his Periphyseon is clearly recognizable: the gloss says, roughly translated, that ‘pure thinking’ is the only way to reach full understanding of the concept of number. The preoccupation with ancient Greek philosophy is also clear: we see Greek words and Greek names such as Theophrastus and Pythagoras.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="bpl88_172_v">

     <h1>Porphyry’s Isagoge</h1>
      <p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived.</p>
       <p>He became an important exponent of Neoplatonism. the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with the Platonic doctrine. </p>
      <p>Porphyry is best known for the Isagoge, an introduction to Aristotle's logical works that soon became an integral part of the Organon (the set of logical works of Aristotle) and one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum.	 </p>
 <p>The Isagoge is an elucidation to Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of. Taking a human for example, genus is “animal”, species “man”, difference “rational”, property “able to speak”, accident “white”. Porphyry’s Isagoge, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became widely influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least 1000 years.</p>
