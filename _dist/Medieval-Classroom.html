      <div class="aoCol1"><h2>Teaching in the Middle Ages</h2><p>In medieval Europe, teaching and learning were firmly in the hands of the church. To learn how to read and write meant to learn Latin, and Latin was the language of the bible and the liturgy. In the earlier middle ages, monasteries were the most important institutions for learning and teaching, and also for the production of books. In the later middle ages, courts, cities and institutions such as universities also became centres of teaching, learning, and for the production of books.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/university.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: nog aanvragen</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Classroom</h2><p>In the early Middle Ages, and especially in the Carolingian period, children became more and more a part of monastic communities and were taught in schools. In the so-called Plan of St. Gall, for example, a map of a real or ideal monastery created in the ninth century, a building is labeled ‘school’ (domus communis scolae), and another one is the house of the master. In these classrooms  discipline was strictly kept. In many stories and pictures, beating seems a crucial pedagogical tool. In manuscripts we find pictures of large and small classes, with young and older students.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/stgall.jpg"><figcaption>St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod.

The traces of all this active reading and studying take many forms, ranging from wide margins, providing ample space for commentary and glosses <a href="Glosses-commentaries.html">Glosses and commentaries</a>, to a narrow format, so that the book could be held in one hand.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span> Obvious traces, furthermore, are annotations by readers, who try to make sense of their texts with summaries, lists, signs and pointers.

        <h1>Porphyry’s Isagoge</h1>
        <p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived.</p>
 <p>He became an important exponent of Neoplatonism. the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with the Platonic doctrine. </p>
        <p>Porphyry is best known for the Isagoge, an introduction to Aristotle's logical works that soon became an integral part of the Organon (the set of logical works of Aristotle) and one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum.	 </p>
 <p>The Isagoge is an elucidation to Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of.
        Taking a human for example, genus is “animal”, species “man”, difference “rational”, property “able to speak”, accident “white”. Porphyry’s Isagoge, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became widely influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least 1000 years.</p>
