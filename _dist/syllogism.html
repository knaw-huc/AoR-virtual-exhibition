For example, if ‘all men are just’ (the universal affirmative proposition) then ‘some men are not just’ (the particular negative proposition) is a contradictory statement.

A syllogism is another way of relating propositions and formally consists of two propositions and a conclusion.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>One term is common to both propositions, or premise, and to the conclusion. By reasoning from what is common between the premises you can come to a reasoned conclusion:</p><p>For example: </p><p>Every horse is an animal.</p><p>Some horses are white.</p><p>Therefore, some animals are white.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span">{{> folios/folio-bpl25_12_r }}</div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Moods of syllogisms</h2><p>Aristotle identified nineteen different ‘moods’ or patterns of syllogisms, which he divided into three ‘figures’, or groupings, with each figure involving a different arrangement of subject and predicate in the premise.</p><p>In this manuscript (BPL 84, f. 63r, a copy of Boethius’ work Introductio ad syllogismos categoricos - CHECK), we can see an exposition of the these three figures.

The unfinished zodiacal scheme on f. 2r might lead us to the same conclusion.

In De nuptiis, IV.422, the figure of Dialectic offers the following example of an argument which combines a categorical and a conditional syllogism: ’if the question is whether dialectic itself is advantageous, the argument should be set out: if it is advantageous to discuss well, the science of discussing well is advantageous; but to discuss well is advantageous; therefore dialectic is advantageous.’ (trans.
