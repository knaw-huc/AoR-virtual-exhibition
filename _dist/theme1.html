    <p>The Medieval Classroom</p><p>In medieval Europe, reading and writing were not for everybody. They were for a small section of society of people who were able to get some kind of schooling, mostly those that devoted their life and career to the church. Latin was the language of the written word, and Latin was what one learned in a monastic or cathedral school. In this section, we will look at the educational programme of these schools: which books were used to teach students the art of reasoning, which texts were read and what is in them? </p>
