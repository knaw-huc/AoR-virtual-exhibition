Medieval practices of disputation were intricately connected to education and teaching. Few women in the Middle Ages had the opportunity to study the liberal arts or were allowed to teach and speak in public. The prescription found in Scripture that women were to remain quiet restricted their access to debate and disputation. In his letter to Timothy, the Apostle Paul was believed to have written: “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man” (1 Tim 2,12). This hardly left any room for women to persuade or dispute. Yet occasionally we do hear of a woman who spoke in public or engaged in disputation with men. Here follow five portraits of disputing women from Antiquity to the high Middle Ages. Many of these portraits were drawn by  others, but on some rare occasions we hear a woman speaking with her own voice. The portraits are listed chronologically, by the period in which they were written. </p></div></div></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/disputing.jpg"><figcaption>Montpellier, BU Médecine, H. 437 (1340, Gossuin de Metz, Image du monde), f. 57v (detail): A woman and a clerc disputing.

She founded a community of women, who practiced an ascetic lifestyle and were dedicated to biblical studies. According to church father Jerome (d. c. 420), who wrote a biography of Marcella shortly after her death, her knowledge of Scripture was widely known. People turned to Marcella to discuss interpretations of Scripture with her.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">2</a></span> </p><p>Jerome pictured Marcella as a modest woman, who was careful not to present her opinions as her own: </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>“Whenever she was asked a question she would give her opinion not as being her own but as being mine or someone else’s so as to admit that she was a student in that in which she was a teacher.

Jerome wrote: “She did not accept as true whatever answer I would give her; and my authority did not prevail with her if it was not supported by reason.

She went straight to the law court of the governor Dacian at Emerita to profess her faith in Christ. During her trial, she defied the Roman magistrates, who were in charge of questioning her, with provocative counter-questions. When the magistrates tried to persuade her to change her position, Prudentius wrote, Eulalia spat in the eyes of her interrogator, abused the governor and destroyed the symbols of his religion.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">7</a></span> </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/eulalia2.jpg"><figcaption>Martyrdom of St. Eulalia of Mérida, 1427-1437, by the Catalan artist Bernat Mortorell Vic, Museu Episcopal de Vic.

As is the case with many martyrdom narratives, the historical veracity of Eulalia’s trial, as described by Prudentius, is in doubt. Yet it is significant that Prudentius could imagine a woman arguing with Roman officials. A remarkable feature of late antique martyr narratives is that female martyrs are often depicted as speaking freely in public.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">8</a></span> In the sixth century, Eulalia’s popularity spread from Spain to Gaul. The poet Venantius Fortunatus (d. 610), who resided in Poitiers, wrote a poem about her. Also, the oldest extant French vernacular poem, dating to the late ninth century, is dedicated to Eulalia .

It marks the opening of Abelard’s autobiography <em>The Story of My Misfortunes (Historia Calamitatum), </em>in which he recounted the story of his love affair and subsequent spiritual friendship with Heloise. The figure on the left represents Abelard, the figure on the right, whose face has been erased, is believed to represent Heloise. They are both holding books. The manuscript not only contains Abelard’s autobiography, but also his correspondence with Heloise. Go to the manuscript portrait of <a href="/lat2923#lat2923">Paris, BnF, lat. 2923</a> to read more about the appreciative remarks that one famous humanist reader added to Heloise’s letters, admiring both her style of writing and her demeanor. Here you will also find an hypothesis as to why Heloise’s face has been rubbed away. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/2923f1r.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 2923, f. 1r (detail)<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84386206" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84386206</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In the late thirteenth century, the poet and cleric Jean de Meun (d. 1305) discovered the letters of Heloise and Abelard. He was much impressed by Heloise’s erudition and in particular by her arguments against marriage. He retold their love story in his continuation of the <em>Roman the la Rose.  </em>This miniature in manuscript Paris, BnF, Département des manuscrits Français, ms. 1560, containing the <em>Roman de la Rose</em>, shows Heloise and Abelard debating love and marriage. The text below the miniature reads: “Peter Abelard admits that sister Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete, would not for anything agree to his marying her.” The column on the right lists Heloise’s arguments against marriage. Jean de Meun concludes: “By my soul, I do not think there has ever been such a woman since. I believe that her erudition enabled her better to conquer  and subdue her nature and its feminine ways . If Peter [Abelard] had believed her, he would never have married her.”<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21">22</a></span> </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p>±m±[romanrose3±m±</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><p>The five women we have encountered in this portrait gallery were remembered for their skills in argumentation and for participating in debates, both in private and in public. But did Marcella, Eulalia, Gundrada, Katherine and Heloise really engage in disputations, or did their biographers and correspondents imagine and idealize their performance and skills? In some cases, we cannot be certain. Yet it is important to note that martyrdom narratives, letters, poems and saints’ lives inspired poets, authors and miniaturists to at least <em>entertain </em>the possibility of women engaging in disputation, amongst themselves, but also with men. This may have opened up possibilities for women to actually participate in debates, in spite of the apostle Paul’s restrictions on women teaching and speaking in public.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><p>Sources used for this contribution:</p><p><em>Primary sources</em></p><ul><li>Abelard, <em>Historia calamitatum, </em>ed.
