      <div class="aoCol1"><h2>Women &amp; disputation</h2><p>Medieval practices of disputation were intricately connected to education and teaching. Few women in the Middle Ages had the opportunity to study the liberal arts or were allowed to teach. Since Scripture prescribed that women were to remain quiet (1 Tim 2,12), this restriction limited their access to debate and disputation. In his letter to Timothy, the Apostle Paul was believed to have written: “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man”. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>This hardly left any room for women to persuade or dispute, without seeming to teach or speak with authority. Yet occasionally we do hear of a woman who spoke in public or engaged in disputation, even with men. Here follow five portraits of disputing women from Antiquity to the high Middle Ages. Many of these portraits were drawn by men, but on some rare occasions we hear a woman speaking with her own voice. The portraits are listed chronological by the period in which they were drawn up.</p></div></div></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/disputing.jpg"><figcaption>Montpellier, BU Médecine, H. 437 (1340, Gossuin de Metz, Image du monde), f. 57v: A woman and a clerc disputing.<br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/decor/104988" class="aorSourceLink">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/decor/104988</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Marcella of Rome (325-410) </h2><p>Marcella (325-410) was a wealthy aristocratic woman from a Christian family. She founded a community of women, who practiced an ascetic lifestyle and were dedicated to biblical studies. According to church father Jerome, Marcella’s knowledge of Scripture was widely known and whenever he was not around in person (sic) people turned to Marcella to ask her questions and discuss interpretations of Scripture with her [Jerome, Ep. 127.7]</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Jerome pictures Marcella as a modest woman, who was careful not to present her opinions as her own: “Whenever she was asked a question she would give her opinion not as being her own but as being mine or someone else’s so as to admit that she was a student in that in which she was a teacher. For she knew that the apostle had said: I do not allow a woman to teach” [Jerome, Ep. 127.7<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span>].</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Jerome’s portrait of Marcella, which he wrote shortly after her death in 410, can be read as that of a humble female scholar who knew her place among men, but also as a veiled acknowledgment that Marcella’s opinions actually <em>were</em> her own. She was a teacher, but presented herself as a student – a clever way to circumvent Paul’s prohibition that barred women from teaching. </p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Marcella inspired Jerome to write a commentary on Paul’s epistle to the Galatians. He framed the commentary as a book of consolatory exegesis, written in her honour. This is the opening miniature of Jerome’s <em>Commentary on the Book of Daniel</em>. The manuscript also contains Jerome’s commentaries on the minor prophets and Ecclesiastes, but not the commentary on Paul’s epistle to the Galatians, the one commentary he actually dedicated to Marcella. The miniature attests to Marcella’s reputation as Jerome’s patron and muse. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/marcella2.jpg"><figcaption>Dijon, BM, Ms. 132 (99) (Cîteaux, Abbey of Notre-Dame, 12th century), f. 1r: Jerome delivers his work to Marcella, accompanied by her student Principia<br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/en/decor/13176" class="aorSourceLink">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/en/decor/13176</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In the prologue, Jerome praises Marcella’s zeal for study and her ardor, which moved her ‘to transcend her sex’. Her stimulating questions contributed to the genesis of this work, all the more since she was not easliy satisfied with his answers. Jerome writes: Contrary to what the Pythagoreans do, she did not accept as true whatever answer I would give her; and my authority did not prevail with her if it was not supported by reason. She examined everything and weighed it all in her sagacious mind, such that I felt that she was not so much my student as my judge.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">2</a></span> </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="gal128_3_">

In the obituary that Jerome wrote for Marcella after she died, he called her a <em>iudex </em>once more. The memoir, which he sent to Marcella’s student Principia (Ep. 127), became known as the <em>Vita Marcellae.</em></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In this memoir, Jerome recalls how Marcella publicly opposed those who supported the doctrines of the scholar Origen (d. 254), who had taught that God was incorporeal. When Jerome’s former friend, Rufinus of Aquileia, published a translation of Origen’s <em>On First Principles </em>and it seemed that Origen’s doctrines were being accepted in Rome, Jerome wrote, Marcella stood up: </p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>“It was then that the holy Marcella, who had long held back lest she should be thought to act from party motives, threw herself into the breach. Conscious that the faith of Rome was now in danger, and that this new heresy was drawing to itself not only priests and monks, but also many of the laity […] she publicly withstood (<em>publice restitit</em>) its teachers choosing to please God rather than men.”<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">5</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>According to Jerome, Marcella played such a vital role in the debate that the success of the condemnation of the heretics should be largely attributed to her efforts (Jerome, Ep. 127.10) </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/origen.jpg"><figcaption>Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 17092 (c. 1160), f. 130v: Author’s portrait of Origen, pen-and-ink drawing.

Her portrait was first drawn a century later, when the Roman Christian poet Prudentius praised her bold resistance to Roman magistrates in his <em>Peristephanon,</em> ‘Crowns of martyrdom’. Prudentius, born in the Roman province Tarragonensis, now Northern Spain, wrote fourteen lyric poems on Hispanic and Roman martyrs. The poems, one of which was dedicated entirely to Eulalia, were a vehicle for his polemical expositions of Christian doctrine, tailored to the taste of an audience familiar with classical literary tradition. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek 136 contains the introduction (<em>accessus</em>) to Prudentius ‘man of secular literature’ (<em>vir saecularis litteraturae</em>). The first codicological unit of this codex, containing Prudentius’ <em>Peristephanon</em> and <em>Cathemerinon</em> dates to c. 900. It was later bound together with a Latin commentary on Aristotle’s <em>On Interpretation (Periermeneias) </em>(thirteenth century) and with Boethius’ <em>Opuscula sacra </em>(c. 1000)</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/gal136.jpg"><figcaption>St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod. sang. 134, p. 2<br><a href="https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0134" class="aorSourceLink">https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0134</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In his poem in praise of Eulalia, Prudentius recounts how thirteen-year old Eulalia ran away from her parents who had brought her to the countryside to escape the persecution of Christians. She travelled to the law court of the governor Dacian at Emerita to profess her faith in Christ and challenge the authorities to martyr her. During the trial, she defied the Roman magistrates who questioned her with provocative counter-questions. When they tried to persuade her to change her position, Prudentius tells us, Eulalia spat in the eyes of her interrogator, abused the governor and destroyed the symbols of his pagan religion. (Prudentius, <em>Peristephanon, Crowns of Martyrdom, </em>III).</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Prudentius does not portray Eulalia as participating in a rational, dialectical disputation, but she surely ‘talks back’ when questioned. As is the case with many martyrdom narratives, the historical veracity of the events at Eulalia’s trial is dubious. Yet what is important here is that Prudentius can imagine a woman arguing with Roman officials. A remarkable feature of late antique martyr narratives is that female martyrs are depicted as speaking freely in public. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>The Roman privilege of free speech (<em>libertas dicendi </em>or, in handbooks of rhetoric <em>parrhesia </em>or <em>licentia</em>)<em>,</em> which used to be the prerogative of free male citizens only, is in these narratives equally ascribed to women. The fact that their opponents were pagans subverted the regular conventions and rules of discourse. It was considered acceptable behaviour for a female martyr to speak truth to power, if that power was pagan. In such circumstances even rude talk and behaviour, such as Eulalia displayed, was considered permissible. Likewise, it was acceptable for a Roman noble lady like Marcella to publicly defend the orthodox faith, if her opponents were heretics. Heresy was a game changer that temporarily suspended the usual restrictions on the public voice of women.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">6</a></span></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In his account of Eulalia’s martyrdom, Prudentius described how a white dove flew from her mouth at the moment of her death.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/eulalia2.jpg"><figcaption>Martyrdom of St. Eulalia of Mérida, 1427-1437 by the Catalan artist Bernat Mortorell.

He wondered how she had managed to keep her virginity while living in the palace.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">9</a></span> Janet Nelson has suggested it may have been Gundrada’s continence that enabled her, in her advisory and educational role, to act as conduit between persons at court and the ruler.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">10</a></span> </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Alcuin often addressed Gundrada with her nickname or pseudonym: Eulalia, ‘of noble speech’. In the literary circle of Charlemagne’s entourage pseudonyms were chosen (or given) from a resemblance with a person from Antiquity. Presumably Gundrada reminded Alcuin of Eulalia, the outspoken martyr of Mérida.</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In 799 or 800, Alcuin (see ±a±ad±a±) sent a letter to a noble lady at the court, in all likelihood Gundrada, with instructions on how to conduct a disputation with a heretic. He sent the letter shortly after he himself disputed the Hispanic bishop Felix, who was accused of teaching the heresy of adoptionism. In his letter, Alcuin praised Gundrada for her knowledge of dialectic and offered to teach her the method of dialectical enquiry <em>(disciplina interrogationes dialecticae</em>). On Alcuin’s proposed method of dialectical enquiry, see The debate on adoptionism (±a±da±a±).</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/reims.jpg"><figcaption>Reims, Bibliothèque Carnegie, Ms. 385 (9th century), f. 158r: Alcuin’s letter to Gundrada/Eulalia.

In his letter he gives a reason for passing this knowledge on to her: he considered the method to be helpful in refuting heretics, in particular those who teach the doctrine of adoptionism. Did Alcuin expect that Gundrada would need to discuss matters of doctrine with those who were sympathetic to the adoptionist school of thought any time soon? Or did he merely wish to show off his own skills in the art of dialectical inquiry? Whatever the reason for writing the letter, Alcuin apparently had no trouble envisioning his addressee debating issues of doctrine with a heretic.

Abelard’s former teacher Roscelin of Compiègne wrote Abelard a letter full of reproach: “Not sparing the virgin entrusted to you, whom you should have taught as a student [..] you taught her not to argue but to fornicate” (“non argumentari sed eam fornicari docuisti’).<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">15</a></span> Looking past the reproach, it is interesting to note that Roscelin implies that Abelard, teacher of dialectic, had been instructed to teach Heloise to argue. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/romanrosefr.jpg"><figcaption>Chantilly, Musée Condé, Ms. 482 (Roman de la Rose, Paris, 1350-1360), f. 60v: Portrait of Abelard and Heloise<br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/en/decor/78892" class="aorSourceLink">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/en/decor/78892</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>When Heloise returned to Paris, they secretly got married, at Abelard’s insistence. To escape the wrath of her uncle, Abelard persuaded Heloise to enter the convent of Argenteuil, where he continued to visit her. Heloise’s family assumed that Abelard had repudiated her and took revenge: Abelard was attacked and castrated. He became a monk in St. Denis. A few years later, he wrote the <em>The Story of My Misfortunes (Historia calamitatum), </em>the first letter in modern editions of their famous correspondence. As Constant Mews has argued, a less well-known collection of letters, the <em>Epistolae duorum amantium (Letters of Two Lovers) </em>should be attributed to an earlier phase in their relationship. In these letters between an anonymous teacher and an equally anonymous student, Abelard employs the terminology of dialectic, when discussing the nature of their relationship, while Heloise takes recourse to a Ciceronian vocabulary of friendship.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">16</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In the late thirteenth century, the cleric Jean de Meung recounted the story of Heloise and Abelard in his continuation of the <em>Roman de la Rose. </em>In his version of their story, shaped as a tragic love affair, he made much of Heloise’s arguments against marriage, which he had encountered in one of her letters to Abelard. In this letter, Heloise strongly argued that the bond of marriage did not suit the philosophical way of life. The name of ‘friend’ or even ‘mistress’, she wrote, would always be sweeter to her than the name of ‘wife’. [Heloise, Ep. 2]</p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>A miniature in a fourteenth-century manuscript of the <em>Roman de la Rose </em>shows Abelard and Heloise debating about love and marriage. Heloise is wearing a habit and a veil, while Abelard is dressed as a layman. The scene depicts the moment when Heloise had just entered the convent of Argenteuil, and Abelard (not yet monk of St. Denis) came to visit her. The rubric reads: 'Comment helouys labeesse entrodit pierres abalart’. Michael Clanchy translates this rubric as: ‘How Peter Abelard instructs Abbess Heloise’<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">17</a></span> Howerver, as Clanchy points out, the hand gestures in the miniature rather indicate debate than instruction.

Here, Heloise  wrote the <em>Problemata Heloissae</em>, a collection of forty-two questions, which she and her sisters raised and Abelard answered. According to Isidore, <em>problemata </em>are propositions or questions that need to be resolved by disputation (<em>Etymologiae</em> 6. 8.14). In the prefatory letter to the <em>Problemata</em>, Heloise writes that she has followed the example of Marcella questioning Jerome. She quotes Jerome saying that Marcella was not so much his pupil but rather his judge. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Only two manuscripts with Heloise’s <em>Problemata</em> have survived. In Paris, BnF. Lat. 14511, dating to the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century, the text opens on f. 18r with the words: “Incipiunt problemata heloise paraclitensis dyaconisse”: “Here begin the <em>Problemata</em> of Heloise deaconess of the Paraclete”. A title added above the text in a cursive hand turns the perspective around and attributes authorship to Abelard: “Solutiones problematum heloise per petrum abailardum”: “Answers to the questions of Heloise by Peter Abelard”. The page on the left, f. 17v is half a leaf. Perhaps the page was cut, because the preceding text ending on f. 17r only had one column. On the verso side of the half-leaf is a drawing of a human figure (encircled in red). The figure looks like a girl with pigtails. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/problemata.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF. Lat. 14511 (Heloise, Problemata; manuscript made in St. Victor around 1400), f. 17v-18r: This section of the manuscript was copied for the humanist scholar Simon Plumetot (1371-1443), who collected texts written by Abelard, which perhaps explains the added title at the top of the page. Plumetot donated this and other manuscripts related to Abelard to the abbey of St-Victor, where he had studied.<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9068387d" class="aorSourceLink">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9068387d</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In the prologue to the <em>Problemata, </em>in which Heloise presented herself as a second Marcella, she cast Abelard in the role of Jerome, asking him to answer the questions of her sisters and herself, just as Jerome had explained complicated issues of Scripture to his female scholar friends. Abelard took up the challenge. The next text in Paris, BnF, lat. 14511, following directly on the <em>Problemata </em>is  “the letter of master Peter Abelard to the virgins of the Paraclete on studies’. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Abelard encourages the sisters to dedicate themselves to biblical studies and learn Greek, Hebrew and Latin under the guidance of Heloise, who, it would appear, mastered these three languages. Abelard’s letter is replete with quotations from Jerome, especially from letters Jerome wrote to women. From Jerome’s letter to Laeta ‘On a girl’s education’, Abelard quotes: I shall take more pride in my task than did the worldly philosopher [Aristotle]. For I shall not be teaching a Macedonian king, fated to die of poison in Babylon, but a handmaid and bride of Christ, destined to be offered the celestial throne.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">19</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/problemata2.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 14511, f. 44v: “Incipit sermo magistri abaelardi ad virgines paraclitenses de studio litterarum”<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9068387d" class="aorSourceLink">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9068387d</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>We learn about Gundrada’s dialectical skills only through Alcuin’s letter and we get to know Marcella through Jerome’s memoir and his replies to her letters. Eulalia’s boldness and Katherine’s disputations are only known through (later) narratives and poems, while Heloise’s work is transmitted as an attachment to Abelard’s writings. Did these five women really argue and dispute with men, or were their disputations part of the imagination of their biographers and correspondents?</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In most cases, we cannot be certain. And yet, imagination is not irrelevant. Prudentius had no problem imagining Eulalia as a militant woman standing up to authorities and giving them a piece of her mind. Alcuin envisioned Gundrada entering into a debate with a heretic and apparently did not consider this inappropriate conduct for a lady at court. The anonymous author of the <em>Passio </em>of Katherine not only mentioned that Katherine disputed with 50 philosophers, but wrote her speeches down in full, rendering her arguments in direct speech. The miniaturist of Chantilly, Musée Condé 482 pictured Heloise engaging in debate with Abelard.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Perhaps images (verbal or pictorial) of female personifications of virtues and vices battling for the human soul, or of Lady Dialectic as a woman who was not to be trifled with induced poets and authors to at least <em>entertain </em>the possibility of women engaging in disputation, amongst themselves, but also with men. This must have opened possibilities for women to actually participate in debates, in spite of the apostle Paul’s restrictions on women teaching and speaking in public. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/prudentius.jpg"><figcaption>London, BL, Cotton Cleopatra C VIII, f. 11r: Female personifications of the virtue ‘Long-suffering’ and the vice ‘wrath’ engaging in combat in Prudentius’ Psychomachia.
