        <div class="aoIntroTextCols"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>The skills of speaking and arguing<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span></h2><p>After a pupil had learnt how to read and write in Latin (<em>grammatica</em>), it was time for a next level of knowledge of the language: learning how to <em>speak</em> well and effectively (<em>rhetorica</em>) and how to build arguments and <em>reason</em> well (<em>dialectica</em>). These skills were needed for many purposes: to speak well is an art needed to get your message across and to convince people, to be able to argue is important for a proper understanding of texts, for using them in debates and for deciding in cases of disagreement. <em>Dialectica </em>became a crucial element in <a href="/theme4#theme4">theological debate</a>. It also became a key element of the university curriculum: every student was thoroughly trained in the skill of dialectical reasoning with the <em>disputatio</em>, a formal game of two opponents reasoning against each other. In this image from the fourteenth-century manuscript Karlruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek, St.Peter perg. 92, <a href="/ramon#ramon">Ramon Llull</a> is portrayed as he is engaged in a dialogue with Thomas Le Myésier. On the left one can follow the structure of the debate, laid out in a diagrammatic form. The two discussants are pointing at the sources for their arguments: a stack of books.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/karlsruhef11v.jpg"><figcaption>Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek, St. Peter perg. 92, f. 11v<br><a href="https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:31-8765" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:31-8765</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><h2>The art of arguing: dialectical disputation</h2><p>The <em>disputatio</em> was an important instrument at the medieval university, as a teaching exercise but also as the most important exam: a formal public disputation was the final step to become a <em>magister</em> at the university. Today we still have a remnant of the medieval practice in many universities all over the world: a public defence of one’s thesis. The oral events were at times recorded in writing. The <em>disputatio </em>also became a literary genre, not necessarily preceded by an actual oral dispute.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>The structure of a disputation</h2><p>Step 1: A <em>magister </em>at the university decided on a question and allocated the roles of <em>respondens</em> (respondent) and <em>opponens</em> (opponent, or, generally, opponents). In an initial session the <em>magister </em>introduced the question as a dialectical question to be answered by yes or no. <br />Step 2: The <em>respondens</em> chose one of these answers, and gave arguments for his position. The <em>opponens</em> (or <em>opponentes</em>) attacked his arguments and his position with counter-arguments.<br />Step 3: The <em>respondens</em> was given the space to respond to the counter-arguments, and give new arguments against the counter-arguments and for his initial position.<br />Step 4: The <em>magister</em> decided who had won the debate, and gave his final solution (<em>solutio</em>) to the question.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/karlsruhef8r.jpg"><figcaption>Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek, St. Peter perg. 92, f. 8r (detail)<br><a href="https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:31-8765" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:31-8765</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2><a id="game"></a>The game of arguing</h2><p>To train the skill of disputing, several exercises were incorporated in the university curriculum. <em>Obligationes</em> (from the term <em>obligatio</em>, obligation or liability) were debates in which one committed oneself to uphold or deny a certain initial statement, after which one was then compelled to also uphold or deny everything that logically followed from that initial statement. It was a game of logical trickery, each party trying to lure the other in admitting to something impossible. Another exercise was the <em>quodlibet</em>, a special kind of disputation about a question on any topic and raised by anyone. The challenge was to be quick on one’s intellectual feet and show the ability to respond to questions of every nature and about any subject.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/15350f1r.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, Lat. 15350, f. 1r (detail): Here is a detail from a manuscript with quodlibetical disputations from, among others, Thomas Aquinas.

Other late-antique texts that were used in the medieval study of rhetoric were the so-called ‘<a href="about:blank">minor Latin rhetoricians</a>’ such as Rutilius Lupus, Iulius Rufinianus, Fortunatianus and Marius Victorinus. Quintilian’s major rhetorical handbook, <em>The Institutes of Oratory</em>, circulated only in incomplete manuscripts. References to it from before the eleventh century are rare. In encyclopaedias, such as Isidore of Seville’s <em>Etymologies</em>, the fundamentals and terminology of rhetoric were discussed. Figures of speech, which one would perhaps expect to be treated here, were generally treated within the discipline of grammar.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/herennium.jpg"><figcaption>Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 158, f. 73r (detail): Opening of 'Rhetorica ad Herennium', here ascribed to Cicero, with a splendid dragon-adorned A.<br><a href="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/sp902vq7011" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/sp902vq7011</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In the ninth century a new work entered the rhetorical curriculum: <a href="/alcuin#alcuin">Alcuin</a>’s <em>Disputatio de rhetorica</em>. In the eleventh and twelfth century a range of new rhetorical commentaries and treatises on the <a href="/lat2923#lat2923"><em>ars dictaminis</em></a> (the art of composing letters) became a firm part of rhetoric. In rhetorical manuals the discipline was further divided up into specific, practical branches: the <em>ars poetica</em>, <em>ars praedicandi</em>, <em>ars notariae</em>, etcetera. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In the thirteenth century, together with the influx of <a href="/text-portraits.html?portait=Aristotle2">Aristotelian logical texts</a>, Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric</em> was reintroduced in the Latin West, in a Latin translation of Herman the German (Hermannus Allemannus). This had an enormous influence on the development of the art of rhetoric: in constructing a general theory of persuasion, Aristotle firmly connected rhetoric to the arts of dialectic and logic. His philosophical approach was avidly picked up in the later Middle Ages.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/lyon.jpg"><figcaption>Lyon, BM, MS 128 (060), f. 2r: Rhetorical manual from the 15th century, with Rhetorica ad Herennium and, among others, an ars praedicandi.<br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/2263/6742" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/2263/6742</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><h2><a id="logica"></a>Dialectica and Logica</h2><p>In some definitions, the art of dialectic and the art of logic were presented as separate, in some they were synonymous. One could make the distinction that Dialectic is the art of making a good argument, Logic of adhering to the rules of sound reasoning. The two were always closely linked to each other: in order to make a convincing argument, it had to make sense. For this reason these two arts were often treated in the same volume or text, or even as one and the same art. Logic, however, had its own set of curricular texts. The body of logical texts known and studied in the earlier Middle Ages is known as the <em>Logica Vetus</em>. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries new texts were added, known as the <em>Logica Nova</em>.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/188f10r.jpg"><figcaption>Cologny, Fondation Martin Bodmer, Cod.

Several works of Aristotle are at the heart of this set, but some of his works came to the Latin West at a later point in time. These are not a part of <em>Logica Vetus</em>, but of <em>Logica Nova</em>, the new translations of Aristotle’s remaining logical treatises that came to the Latin West in the twelfth century. Many of the treatises of the <em>Logica Vetus </em>were made available by <a href="about:blank">Boethius</a>, who, in the late fifth/early sixth century made it his project to translate from Greek to Latin all the works of Plato and Aristotle and to provide commentaries on them. We have his translation of Aristotle's <a href="about:blank"><em>Categories</em></a><a href="about:blank"> and </a><a href="about:blank"><em>On Interpretation</em></a>, and Porphyry’s <em><a href="about:blank">Isagoge</a>.</em> He also composed supplementary works, such as the <em>Book of Six Principles</em> and works about <a href="/syllogism#syllogism">syllogisms</a>, a crucial tool for logical reasoning. The texts of <em>Logica Vetus</em> played a major role in the formation of the discipline of dialectic and logic. They were studied from the early Middle Ages on, and remained in use in the times of the medieval universities.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/darmstadt3.jpg"><figcaption>Darmstadt, Universität- und Landesbibliothek, Hs. 2282, f. 1v<br><a href="http://tudigit.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/show/Hs-2282" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">http://tudigit.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/show/Hs-2282</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In manuscript Darmstadt, Universität- und Landesbibliothek, Hs. 2282, Lady Dialectic is depicted in the middle of the image.

Boethius had already translated many of the logical works of Aristotle, but not his <em>Prior</em> and <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, the <em>Topica</em> and <em>Sophistici elenchi </em>(read more about these texts <a href="about:blank">here</a>). With these new texts and commentaries and a new emphasis on Aristotle’s texts in the medieval university curriculum, fresh translations and commentaries flourished: William of Moerbeke, Thomas Aquinas, Robert Kilwardby and many other known and unknown medieval authors produced new commentaries. In the first decades of the thirteenth century, Aristotle’s works soon became the foundation of teaching in the Arts Faculties of medieval Europe. Logic became a fundamental subject, central to the programme. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Handbooks with collections of logical texts set out in a certain format testify to this.
