Born c. 940 and murdered during a monastic skirmish in 1004, he was one of the leading intellectuals of the tenth century. Abbo entered the monastery of Fleury as pupil at the age of seven, becoming a monk in his early teens.</p></div></div></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/orleans.jpg"><figcaption>Orléans, BM, MS 277, p. 1: The manuscript opens with Aristotle’s Categories, in the translation by Boethius, a key dialectical work.<br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/3009/8089" class="aorSourceLink">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/3009/8089</a></figcaption></figure></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/orleans2.jpg"><figcaption>Orléans, BM, MS 277, p. 1<br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/3009/8089" class="aorSourceLink">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/3009/8089</a></figcaption></figure></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/orleans3.jpg"><figcaption>Orléans, BM, MS 175, p. 175: Sketch from a manuscript copied in Fleury during the abbacy of Abbo (988-1004)<br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/2975/8051" class="aorSourceLink">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/codex/2975/8051</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Gerbert of Aurillac</h2><p>A near contemporary of Abbo, Gerbert of Aurillac was born c. 946. In 999 he became Pope, taking the name Sylvester II. He died in 1003. Gerbert is also an influential figure in the history of medieval science. During a period in Spain he was influenced by advanced Arabic mathematics, and on his return to the the north of France introduced the abacus, a counting device.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/scaliger.jpg"><figcaption>Leiden UB, Scaliger MS 38, f. 2r: This manuscript, which contains a number of Gerbert’s mathematical and astronomical works, opens with this table of numeric terms.<br><a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1887.1/item:882068" class="aorSourceLink">http://hdl.handle.net/1887.1/item:882068</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Intellectual networks</h2><p>Gerbert became head of the cathedral school in Rheims in 972 while Abbo taught at the monastic school of Fleury prior to his elevation to abbot in 988. Thanks to their powerful ecclesiastical positions, they built up networks of political and intellectual acquaintances, useful sources for obtaining manuscripts of rare texts. Gerbert, for example, wrote to Constantine, <em>scolasticus</em> or schoolmaster at Fleury, requesting works of Cicero, such as the <em>Republic</em> and the <em>Verrine Orations</em>. See another letter of Gerbert <em>here. </em>±a±m11±a±</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/7185.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 7185, f. 49r: A decorated initial from the opening of a twelfth-century copy of Gerbert’s De geometria<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10544638r" class="aorSourceLink">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10544638r</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Abbo’s education</h2><p>Abbo’s studies are described in the <em>Vita</em> or <em>Life </em>written by Aimoin of Fleury, written shortly after Abbo’s death in 1004 <em>(Patrologia Latina, </em>139, col. 0309B). Aimoin emphasises Abbo’s well-rounded education. He was trained in grammar, arithmetic and dialectic at Fleury as a child, before going to Paris and Reims, where he learned philosophy (’<em>philosophia</em>’, presumably advanced logic) and astronomy. He then travelled to his homeplace, Orléans, where he studied music.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>As Aimoin points out, Abbo was then well-versed in five out of the seven liberal arts, but taught himself rhetoric and geometry. Aimoin comments that Abbo read ‘Victorinus’, the fourth-century author of a commentary on Cicero’s <em>De inventione.</em> [link to copy of Victorinus in Gerard d’Abbeville presentation]</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/71852.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 7185, f. 191v: Sketches of musical instruments<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10544638r" class="aorSourceLink">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10544638r</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>The revival of the logica vetus</h2><p>The body of works referred to as the <em>logica vetus, </em>or ‘old logic’, included many texts translated from the Greek, notably those made by Boethius. In addition to his translations, Boethius made a number of commentaries on the most important works. These commentaries became significant dialectical textbooks in their own rights. The texts of the <em>logica vetus</em> were often combined in manuscripts. Both Abbo and Gerbert were instrumental figures in the revival of interest in the <em>logica</em> vetus in the late tenth century, introducing these works to new generations of students.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p>See examples of manuscripts containing the logica vetus here: [vul in!]</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Abbo and Dialectic<br />Abbo wrote a number of dialectical treatises influenced by the corpus of works included in the <em>logica vetus.</em> Abbo made use of diagrams and tables to illustrate and explain his works, many of which were copied by his fellow monks in the scriptorium in Fleury.

Richer continues (III.47) to list Boethius’s other works, including <em>De topicis differentiis </em>and his works on syllogisms.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>As well as providing a list of titles, Richer also offers a few biographical details about their authors. He notes that Boethius’s commentary on the <em>Isagoge </em>depended on a translation of the text by the rhetorician Marius Victorinus. He comments that Cicero’s <em>Topica</em> was translated by ‘Tullius’ from Greek into Latin, and adds that Boethius, who he refers to as ‘Manilius’ was a consul (an important political role in the Ostrogothic kingdom). These details underscored the authorities of their authors.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/nal1478.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, NAL 1478, f. 56r: A list of Boethius’s rhetorical and dialectical works in a late tenth-century manuscript from the monastery of Cluny.<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10546493x" class="aorSourceLink">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10546493x</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Gerbert’s Curriculum: Rhetoric</h2><p>Richer also (<em>Historia</em> III.47) also describes Gerbert’s rhetorical curriculum. To learn the art of eloquence, students read the Latin poets Virgil, Statius and Terence along with the satirical works of Juvenal, Persius and Horace. In addition, they read Lucan’s histories – presumably the <em>Pharsalia</em>, a lengthy epic poem. Richer emphasises that Gerbert’s rhetorical curriculum didn’t depend on rhetorical classics, such as Cicero’s <em>De inventione</em>, but on the practical study of rhetoric as applied in exemplary Latin works. For an example of a manuscript containing some of these texts, see Paris, BnF lat. 7900A ±a±m79±a±</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/nal14782.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF NAL 1478, f. 91r: This note on a flyleaf reads ‘Hugo puer proba’, ’Hugo, the boy, tests [his pen]’ – the mark of an attentive student?<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10546493x" class="aorSourceLink">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10546493x</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Gerbert’s Curriculum in Practice</h2><p>Richer (III.48) offers a further insight to Gerbert’s practice-driven curriculum. ‘After they had been instructed in this art [rhetoric], he brought in a sophist with whom they practised <em>controversiae</em>,  and they conducted themselves in such a way that they seemed to act without any art at all, which is the greatest achievement for an orator.’<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span> Gerbert’s students practiced rhetorical and dialectical argumentation, using what they had learned from the corpus of ancient texts.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/7740.jpg"><figcaption>Decorated initial from BnF lat. 7740, f. 1r, depicting Cicero and Plato arguing over the nature of rhetoric.<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b100343611/f2.image.r=7740" class="aorSourceLink">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b100343611/f2.image.r=7740</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Gerbert and Abbo: Friends or Foes?</h2><p>Gerbert and Abbo were leading intellectual figures of their day, but they seem to have had little to no contact. Were they rivals? The silence of the sources might suggest so. In 980 Gerbert wrote a letter to Constantine, monk of Fleury,  introducing his writings on the abacus. In this letter he criticised a ’half-educated philosopher’ who ‘really still a learner along with me’, ‘pretends that only he has knowledge of it, as Horace says’ [adapted from H. P. Lattin (trans.) <em>The Letters of Gerbert </em>(Columbia, 1961), p. 45].</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>This ‘half-educated philosopher’ has often been presumed to be Abbo, but in truth Gerbert could have been criticising anyone who prized the appearance of knowledge over its possession.  In quoting from Horace (Letters II.I.87), Gerbert is also showing off his classical knowledge to Constantine, and so playing an intellectual game which we cannot necessarily over-interpret.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/vlq33.jpg"><figcaption>Leiden UB, VLQ 33, f. 1v: Depiction of Rhetoric as a female warrior (on the left) in conversation with two figures dressed in antiquated clothing.<br><a href="undefined" class="aorSourceLink">undefined</a></figcaption></figure></p><div class="notes"><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> (translated in J.
