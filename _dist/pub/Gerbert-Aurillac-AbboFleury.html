In 999 he became Pope, taking the name Sylvester II. He died in 1003. Gerbert is also an influential figure in the history of medieval science. During a period in Spain he was influenced by advanced Arabic mathematics, and on his return to the the north of France introduced the abacus, a counting device.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/scaliger.jpg"><figcaption>Leiden UB, Scaliger MS 38, f. 2r.

Thanks to their powerful ecclesiastical positions, they built up networks of political and intellectual acquaintances, useful sources for obtaining manuscripts of rare texts. Gerbert, for example, wrote to Constantine, <em>scolasticus</em> or schoolmaster at Fleury, requesting works of Cicero, such as the <em>Republic</em> and the <em>Verrine Orations</em>.

Aimoin emphasises Abbo’s well-rounded education. He was trained in grammar, arithmetic and dialectic at Fleury as a child, before going to Paris and Reims, where he learned philosophy (’<em>philosophia</em>’, presumably advanced logic) and astronomy. He then travelled to his homeplace, Orleans, where he studied music.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>As Aimoin points out, Abbo was then well-versed in five out of the seven liberal arts, but taught himself rhetoric and geometry. Aimoin comments that Abbo read ‘Victorinus’, the fourth-century author of a commentary on Cicero’s <em>De inventione.</em> [link to copy of Victorinus in Gerard d’Abbeville presentation]</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure><img src="images/content/71852.jpg"><figcaption>Sketches of musical instruments: BnF lat. 7185, f. 179v<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Abbo and Dialectic<br />Abbo wrote a number of dialectical treatises influenced by the corpus of works included in the <em>logica vetus, </em>including translations of Aristotle. He made use of diagrams and tables to illustrate and explain his works, many of which were copied by his fellow monks in the scriptorium in Fleury.

</div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Gerbert’s Curriculum: Dialectic</h2><p>Like Abbo, Gerbert was instrumental in the revival of interest in the <em>logica vetus</em>. In his <em>Historia </em>(III.46)<em>, </em>the chronicler Richer of Saint-Remi describes the texts which Gerbert used to teach dialectic: Porphyry’s <em>Isagoge </em>with Boethius’s commentary, along with translations of Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em> and <em>Periermenias, </em>and Cicero’s <em>Topica, </em>again with Boethius’s six-book commentary. Richer continues (III.47) to list Boethius’s other works, including <em>De topicis differentiis </em>and his works on syllogisms.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>As well as providing a list of titles, Richer also offers a few biographical details about their authors. He notes that Boethius’s commentary on the <em>Isagoge </em>depended on a translation of the text by the rhetorician Marius Victorinus. He comments that Cicero’s <em>Topica</em> was translated by ‘Tullius’ from Greek into Latin, and adds that Boethius, who he refers to as ‘Manilius’ was a consul (an important political role in the Ostrogothic kingdom). These details underscored the authorities of their authors.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure><img src="images/content/nal1478.jpg"><figcaption>A list of Boethius’s rhetorical and dialectical works in BnF lat.

To learn the art of eloquence, students read the Latin poets Virgil, Statius and Terence along with the satirical works of Juvenal, Persius and Horace. In addition, they read Lucan’s histories – presumably the <em>Pharsalia</em>, a lengthy epic poem. Richer emphasises that Gerbert’s rhetorical curriculum didn’t depend on rhetorical classics, such as Cicero’s <em>De inventione</em>, but on the practical study of rhetoric as applied in exemplary Latin works. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/nal14782.jpg"><figcaption>This note on a flyleaf of BnF NAL 1478 (f. 91r), a collection of Boethius’s works, reads ‘Hugo puer proba’, ’Hugo, the boy, tests [his pen]’ – the mark of an attentive student?<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Gerbert’s Curriculum in Practice</h2><p>Richer (III.48) offers a further insight to Gerbert’s practice-driven curriculum. ‘After they had been instructed in this art [rhetoric], he brought in a sophist with whom they practised <em>controversiae</em>,  and they conducted themselves in such a way that they seemed to act without any art at all, which is the greatest achievement for an orator.’<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span> Gerbert’s students practiced rhetorical and dialectical argumentation, using what they had learned from the corpus of ancient texts.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/7740.jpg"><figcaption>Decorated initial from BnF lat. 7740, f. 1r, depicting Cicero and Plato arguing over the nature of rhetoric.<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Gerbert and Abbo: Friends or Foes?</h2><p>Gerbert and Abbo were leading intellectual figures of their day, but they seem to have had little to no contact. Were they rivals? The silence of the sources might suggest so. In 980 Gerbert wrote a letter to Constantine, monk of Fleury,  introducing his writings on the abacus. In this letter he criticised a ’half-educated philosopher’ who ‘really still a learner along with me’, ‘pretends that only he has knowledge of it, as Horace says’ [adapted from H. P. Lattin (trans.) <em>The Letters of Gerbert </em>(Columbia, 1961), p. 45].</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>This ‘half-educated philosopher’ has often been presumed to be Abbo, but in truth Gerbert could have been criticising anyone who prized the appearance of knowledge over its possession.  In quoting from Horace (Letters II.I.87), Gerbert is also showing off his classical knowledge to Constantine, and so playing an intellectual game which we cannot necessarily over-interpret.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure><img src="images/content/vlq33.jpg"><figcaption>Leiden UB, VLQ 33, f. 1v: Depiction of Rhetoric as a female warrior (on the left) in conversation with two figures dressed in antiquated clothing.<br>Source: Universiteitsbibliotheek Leiden</figcaption></figure></p><div class="notes"><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> (translated in J.

        <h1>Porphyry’s Isagoge</h1>
        <p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived.</p>
 <p>He became an important exponent of Neoplatonism. the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with the Platonic doctrine. </p>
        <p>Porphyry is best known for the Isagoge, an introduction to Aristotle's logical works that soon became an integral part of the Organon (the set of logical works of Aristotle) and one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum.	 </p>
 <p>The Isagoge is an elucidation to Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of.
        Taking a human for example, genus is “animal”, species “man”, difference “rational”, property “able to speak”, accident “white”. Porphyry’s Isagoge, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became widely influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least 1000 years.</p>
