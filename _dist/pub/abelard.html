      <div class="aoCol1"><h2>Peter Abelard/ Petrus Abaelardus (c. 1079-1142)</h2><p>Peter Abelard was a scholastic philosopher. He studied with Roscelin and later with William of Champeaux in Paris, at the cathedral school of Notre Dame. Abelard writes in his autobiographal letter <em>The Story of My Troubles (Historia calamitatum) </em>that he fell out with his master, because he defeated William in argument. Abelard set up a school of his own in Corbeil, near Paris. A third period of study followed, when Abelard decided to study theology with Anselmus of Laon. From the mid-1130’s he taught in the schools on the Mont Ste.-Genevieve in Paris. Among Abelard’s students were three popes, several heads of state and, notably, Heloise d’Argentueil, with whom he corresponded until the end of his life (see women and disputation <a href="women-disputation.html">women and disputation</a>)</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/abelard.jpg"><figcaption>Statue of Abelard by Jules Cavalier, before 1853, Palais de Louvre<br>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Abelard is called “the greatest logician of the middle ages”<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span> Among his early works on logic is the <em>Dialectica. </em>It was written before 1117 and based on lectures he gave in Paris in 1115-6.

In the margins of early medieval manuscripts, centuries before Abelard, annotators weighed and assessed statements of authorities, so they could be used to construct a logical and persuasive argument. Unfortunately there is not a single digitized medieval manuscript of Abelard’s <em>Sic et non </em>to show in this exhibition. We can, however,  show a sixteenth-century paper transcript: Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 165.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/165p1.jpg"><figcaption>Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 165, s.

Supporters and opponents testify that he never lost an argument. When his theological writings attracted the attention of abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, who objected to Abelard’s philosophical analysis of the Trinity and his rational approach to matters of faith, Abelard asked the archbishop of Sense to arrange a public disputation between himself and Bernard.  </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p>[[[Bernardus.jpg]]]</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>The disputation never took place.

        <h1>Porphyry’s Isagoge</h1>
        <p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived.</p>
 <p>He became an important exponent of Neoplatonism. the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with the Platonic doctrine. </p>
        <p>Porphyry is best known for the Isagoge, an introduction to Aristotle's logical works that soon became an integral part of the Organon (the set of logical works of Aristotle) and one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum.	 </p>
 <p>The Isagoge is an elucidation to Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of.
        Taking a human for example, genus is “animal”, species “man”, difference “rational”, property “able to speak”, accident “white”. Porphyry’s Isagoge, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became widely influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least 1000 years.</p>

in any depth, but appears to have consulted them mainly for reference. His main interest remained with the <em>logica vetus</em></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>His contemporaries, and especially his students, appreciated Abelard for his commentaries and glosses on the curriculum of the <em>logica vetus</em>. He livened up his lectures with self-ironic examples to amuse his students and make dry logic more palpable, such as “His girl loves Peter” as the converse of “Peter loves his girl”. In the glosses that have survived in Munich, Clm 14479 he made fun of his own slight stature when illustrating different types of contradiction:  … it can apply equally to both “Peter will close this door, Peter will not close this door”; or it relates more to another, as “Peter will fall into the latrine, Peter will not fall into the latrine” relates more to falling, because he is small, even if great in forbearance. Munich, Clm 14479, f. 53v , translation Mews, 2004, 35</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Among modern scholars, Abelard is less known for his glosses on logic than for a work that he wrote around 1120, <em>Sic et non.</em> In <em>Sic et non (For and Against) </em>he placed 158 opposing arguments and seemingly conflicting statements from scriptural and patristic authorities against one another, to stimulate reflection and debate. In the preface he formulates the purpose of his collection: “by doubting we come to question, and by questioning we arrive at truth”. <em>Sic et non</em> is commonly regarded as a landmark in the history of critical thinking and an important step in development of the scholastic method of the <em>disputatio. </em>[Novikoff, Weijers, Rexroth] </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Abelard’s<em> Sic et non </em>is, however, not as innovative as would appear at first sight. The method of collecting apparently contradicting statements was widely applied among the glossators of Roman law at the end of the eleventh century [Flechner], and traces of a similar method of weighing and assessing authorities can be found in the margins and blank spaces of early medieval manuscripts</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Here we see a sixteenth-century paper transcript of Abelard’s <em>Sic et non.</em> On a flyleaf a note is added, taken from the work of abbot Trithemius of Trondheim (1462-1516), who wrote an assessment of ‘Peter, the dialectician of Paris’ (Petrus dialecticus Parisiensis) In the note, Trithemius refers to the council of Sens of 1141 where the ‘depraved doctrine’ of Abelard was condemned, thanks to ‘the efforts of Saint Bernard’. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure><img src="images/content/165p1.jpg"><figcaption>Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 165, s.

XVI, flyleaf<br>Source: Parker Library</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>It was, however, not for writing the <em>Sic et non </em>that Abelard was condemned but for his theological treatises. His philosophical analysis of the Trinity caused a stir among ecclesiastical authorities such as Bernardus of Clairvaux, who charged him with heresy. Abelard’s theological writings, the ensuing condemnations, and his illicit love affair with Heloise d’Argenteuil, are discussed in another section of this exhibition <a href="abelard.html">Abelard and the council of Sense</a>. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Abelard’s logical works sprang from lectures he gave to his students and occasionally preserve classroom debates [Novikoff 2014, 331]. He kept revising his work as he changed his view. As a result of this working method, which was in fact very similar to that of Aristotle himself (Kennedy, 1999, 75), his work has survived in different versions in often incomplete manuscripts. This is why most of his writings are hard to date and provide Abelard-scholars with a headache. At the same time, the complicated circumstances of transmission make studying Abelard all the more interesting, because the different versions, gaps, revisions, additions and corrections allow the reader to see a scholar’s mind at work. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><div class="notes"><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> King, Peter and Arlig, Andrew, "Peter Abelard", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </em>(Fall 2018 Edition), Edward N.
