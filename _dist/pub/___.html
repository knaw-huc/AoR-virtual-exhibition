    <h1>The iconography of dialectica from treacherous to respectable</h1>

    <div class="aoCol1"><h2>Treacherous or respectable? The iconography of dialectica </h2><p>In late antiquity dialectica met with suspicion. Heated disputations had disrupted thecouncils of the early church, with the result that dialectica itself came to be considered a threat to the unity andstability of christian communities. This suspicion lived on in the early middle ages. With the rise of the scholastic method, however, dialectica’s reputation improved considerably. This development is reflected in the verbal imagery and pictorial representations of dialectica, and in particular in the iconography of Lady Dialectic. The following images show dialectica’s metamorphosis from treacherous woman to queen of the Trivium.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/dialectica.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: undefined</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Traditionally, dialectica was associated with imagery of violence and military battle. Attributed to the philosopher Zeno is the saying: Rhetoric is an open hand, dialectic a clenched fist. In this late ninth, early tenth century manuscript of logical texts, Paris, BnF, lat, 12949. Zeno’s saying is added in the blank space preceding Augustine’s De dialectica. It is accompanied by a nota sign.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="12949f12rfr2">

In this illustration in a tenth-century manuscript, that closely follows Martianus’ description, Lady Dialectica holds a wax tablet with attractive premises for discussion to draw her opponents near.  When they are close enough, she reels them in with a hook.

The hook however stands for a harmful, ensnaring conclusion” Note how the illustrator has moved the hook from Dialectica’s right hand (where Martianus placed it) to her left. Perhaps he or she considered it impossible to hold tablets ánd a hook in one hand. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/dialecticahook.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Martianus: </p><p>In her left hand she held a snake entwined in immense coils […] since her left hand kept de crafty device of the snake hidden under her cloak, her right hand was offered to one and all.

If no one wanted to take the premises, Dialectia confronted them with some questions, or secretly stirred the snake to creep up on them until its tight embrace strangled those who were caught and compelled them to accept the will of their interrogator.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/dialecticasnake.jpg"><figcaption>The illustrator chose to present two snakes instead of one.

Although it was acknowledged that dialectic <em>could</em> be used as a critical tool to distinguish true from false, sophisms (a clever but false argument, used deliberately to deceive) were the object of distrust</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/serpent.jpg"><figcaption>Lyon, BM 5128, f.269v Avignon, c.1350-1360 Decretum Gratianum<br>Source: Lyon</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Perhaps it was hardly surprising that dialectica was associated with the misleading and treacherous charms of the serpent. After all, it was the serpent who seduced Eve and Adam to eat from the tree of knowledge, so they would be like God and know the distincion between good and evil. Dialectica made a similar promise as the serpent: teaching to distiniguish between true and false. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/adameve.jpg"><figcaption>El Escorial, Biblioteca del monasterio, cod. & II, 5, s. 10, f. 18r Beatus de Liébana, Commentary on the Apocalypse<br>Source: Biblioteca del monasterio</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>The serpent as symbol of heresy </h2><p>Dialectica’s serpent sprang from an association of dialectic with venom, which was in turn associated with heretics: experts in false and misleading reasoning. Church father Ambrose contrasted the dialectical, venomous disputations of Arian heretics to the simple faith of Christians “For they [the heretics] store up all the strength of their poisons in dialectical disputation, which by the judgment of philosophers is defined as having no power to build anything; it only aims at destruction. For it was not by dialectic that it pleased God to save his people. The kingdom of God resides in simplicity of faith, not in contention of words.” <span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/prosper.jpg"><figcaption>In this ninth-century manuscript of Prosper of Aquitaine’s chronicle, snakes in the margin warn the reader that a heretic is about to enter the narrative.

Dialectica stands on a footstool and is wearing a crown. Above her head is written ‘dialectica domina’. Her left hand still holds the serpent. But the beast is no longer hidden under her cloak as a treacherous weapon but held openly and proudly, as if it were a scepter. In her right hand, the tablets with attractive premises, described by Martianus, have been replaced  by a porphyrian tree. ±a±3ds± This is a significant change of attribute.

The scorpion was considered to be a type of serpent.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/scorpion.jpg"><figcaption>De scorpione “According to Solinus, the scorpion is a serpent with a friendly face like a maiden but has a poisonous sting in Its knotty tail” Thomas of Cantimpré, De natura rerum.

Logic can be used for good and for bad. In his words: “the one hand provokes laughter, the other ends with tears, the one captures, the other chases away, the one moves, the other poisons, the one anoints, the other stings” Like Martianus’ Lady Dialectica, Alanus’ Maiden Logica is an untrustworthy woman. Her right hand, her good side, in the end only serves the treacherous intentions of the left hand<em>: manus sinistra</em> - her  ‘sinister’ side.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Maiden Logica has many faces. Even her scorpion is two-faced. See the earlier description Alanus gives of the pair in <em>The Complaint of Nature</em> (<em>De planctu naturae</em>) (c. 1160) “The faces of the third (Logica) turned and alternated, now promised a kindly clearness, now gave itself up to the clouds of obscurity. On this the figure of a scorpion stood out, and foretold with its face laughter, with the sting of its tail tears.”</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>From the 12th century onwards, stone carvings of Lady dialectica and her sisters from the liberal arts can be found in portals of cathedrals, for example in Laon, Auxerre and in Chartres. The iconography and location attest to the status of the artes as resources of knowledge of God’s creation. Scholasticism is often directly associated with Gothic architecture, harmonizing Christan theology with Aristotelian methods of logical argument and debate.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">2</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="chartres">

        <p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived.</p>
 <p>He became an important exponent of Neoplatonism. the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with the Platonic doctrine. </p>
        <p>Porphyry is best known for the Isagoge, an introduction to Aristotle's logical works that soon became an integral part of the Organon (the set of logical works of Aristotle) and one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum.	 </p>
 <p>The Isagoge is an elucidation to Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of.
        Taking a human for example, genus is “animal”, species “man”, difference “rational”, property “able to speak”, accident “white”. Porphyry’s Isagoge, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became widely influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least 1000 years.</p>
