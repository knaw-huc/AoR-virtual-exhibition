        <div class="aoIntroTextCols">
      <div class="aoCol1"><p>Gerard D’Abbeville was a master of theology at the University of Paris and a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. Unlike his contemporaries, the Dominican Thomas Aquinas and the Fransiscan Bonaventure, Gerard was a secular master teaching at the University of Paris and did not belong to any of the new religious orders founded in the thirteenth century.’</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/paris.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: undefined</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><p>In the third quarter of the 13<sup>th</sup> century there arose a conflict at the University of Paris. Secular clerics opposed the teachers from Franciscan and Dominican mendicant orders. They quarreled about practical topics such as the right to occupy chairs in theology and theological questions such as the role of poverty within Christianity. Both sides –Aquinas and Bonaventure being on the side of the mendicants- published <em>quodlibeta</em> ( topics for or exercises in philosophical or theological discussion) to underline their points. It was Abbeville who rekindled the fire of the debates in 1269 by attacking the mendicant order in a sermon and a quodlibet during Lent. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Library of Sorbonne</h2><p>Gerard was a friend and colleague of Robert de Sorbon, who founded the college of the Sorbonne in 1253. Gerard’s commitment to the institution is evident from his will (1272). He bequeathed the library about 300 manuscripts, doubling the existing collection of the college. Libraries in this period were frequently built up by private donation, but the scale of Gerard’s donation is impressive.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/books.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: nog aanvragen</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In his will Gerard stipulated that his books – mainly theological works, but also philosophical and medical manuscripts – could be freely used at the Sorbonne by all <em>secular</em> students and masters, subtly excluding access to them by his old sparring partners, the members of the mendicant orders. The religious orders, he commented, already had enough. As well as the books, Gerard donated his book cupboard (<em>armarium</em>) and three of his ‘best chests’ to store the library, insisting that the collection was to be inspected yearly and inventorised. Gerard’s stipulations hint at the formalisation of institutional library practices in this period.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/chainedbook.jpg"><figcaption>Did you know that Ramon Llull was also a frequent user of the library of Sorbonne? In 1311 he donated the library a copy of his works and requested that it would be chained to the bookcase; a common but not so subtle way of preventing a book from being stolen.<br>Source: undefined</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Where did Gerard get his books?</h2><p>Many of Gerard’s books belonged to Richard de Fournival (d. 1260), a thirteenth-century poet, medic and  astrologer who was Chancellor at the cathedral in Amiens. Richard wrote a catalogue of his books, <em>Biblionomia</em> (now Paris, Bibliothèque de Sorbonne, MS 636, which classified his manuscripts by subject), listing titles which were ‘must haves’ for medieval scholars. These included key works of rhetoric and dialectic: of Aristotle, Boethius, and Cicero, but also of the Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali (c. 1056-111) and the Spanish philosopher and translator of Arabic works, Dominicus Gundissalinus (c. 1115-90). </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="103_1_r_fr">

        <h1>Porphyry’s Isagoge</h1>
        <p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived.</p>
 <p>He became an important exponent of Neoplatonism. the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with the Platonic doctrine. </p>
        <p>Porphyry is best known for the Isagoge, an introduction to Aristotle's logical works that soon became an integral part of the Organon (the set of logical works of Aristotle) and one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum.	 </p>
 <p>The Isagoge is an elucidation to Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of.
        Taking a human for example, genus is “animal”, species “man”, difference “rational”, property “able to speak”, accident “white”. Porphyry’s Isagoge, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became widely influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least 1000 years.</p>
