      <div class="aoCol1"><h2>A controversial art?</h2><p>In late Antiquity, dialectical disputations were a favourite pastime of the educated elite. Among early Christians, however, the art of dialectical argumentation increasingly met with distrust [Lim, 1995]. Heated disputations disrupted the synods of the early church, with the result that dialectical argumentation itself came to be considered a threat to the unity and stability of Christian communities. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>The Christian author Tertullian (d. 220) blamed Aristotle for introducing this ‘root of contention’:  “Wretched Aristotle! Who invented dialectic for these men, the art which destroys as much as it  builds.” The distrust of dialectic as a  source of controversy and strife lived on in the early middle ages. With the rise of scholasticism in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the reputation of dialectic improved considerably. The next section shows verbal and visual images of dialectic, reflecting a development in which dialectic gradually became more socially acceptable and reliable. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/platoaristotle.jpg"><figcaption>Plato and Aristotle in dispute. The relief represents the art of dialectic and is part of a series of the seven liberal arts made by Lucca della Robbia for the belltower of the Duomo in Florence, 15th century. Museo dell’ Opera del Duomo, Florence.<br>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In Antiquity, dialectica was associated with images of conflict and assault. The philosopher Zeno of Elea (c. 490-430 BC) is reported to have said: ‘Rhetoric is an open hand, dialectic a clenched fist.’ (Cicero, <em>Orator </em>1130) The latter image invokes the setting of a boxing match and supports the notion that those who enter in a dialectical disputation do not set out for a friendly exchange of opinions, but aim to win an argument and take their opponent down to the ground. In many late antique narrative accounts of dialectical disputations the debate only is over when one of the two disputants is reduced to silence [Lim 1995] - and is verbally knocked out. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>As this sixteenth-century fresco of the philosopher Zeno illustrates, dialectic not only invoked negative connotations of conflict and contention, but was also associated positively with truth-finding and discernment. Dialectic served as a tool to distinguish between true and false, between valid and invalid assertions. According to Diogenes Laertius, dialectic was ‘the science of statements, true, false and neither true or false’ (Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers </em>VII, 42) </p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/zeno.jpg"><figcaption>Zeno of Elea shows youths the door to truth and falsity. Fresco by Pellegrino Tibaldi, c. 1588- 1599, Madrid, El Escoria.<br>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In classical narrative representations of debates, however, analogies of physical clashes prevail. Plato’s dialogue <em>Protagoras </em>(c. 380 BC) offers another example of Zeno’s boxing metaphor. A debate between Socrates and the sophist Protagoras is depicted as a boxing match, complete with ground rules, a referee and a cheering audience [Pappas 2016, 77] .<em> </em>Socrates out-performs Protagoras and manages to defeat his sophistry but not before receiving some heavy blows himself. After being ‘hit’ by a particularly effective argument of his opponent, Socrates is reported to have said:  “Many of the audience cheered and applauded this. And I felt at first giddy and faint, as if I had received a blow from the hand of an expert boxer”<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></span> </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/boxing.jpg"><figcaption>Boxing scene: athletes in guard position.

One of the oldest descriptions of Lady Dialectic, depicting her as a clever but untrustworthy woman, can be found in Martianus Capella’s encyclopaedia of the liberal arts, dating to the early fifth century. See text portrait Martianus</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>The oldest surviving illustrated manuscript of Martianus’ encyclopedia of the liberal arts is Paris, BnF lat. 7900A, which dates to the tenth century. The illustrator depicted Lady Dialectic on the verso opposite the opening page of Martianus’ chapter on dialectic</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In the ninth century, scholars John Scot and Remigius of Auxerre <a href="School-Auxerre.html">The school of Auxerre:  Heiric and Remigius</a> wrote comments on Martianus’ chapter on dialectic. It is worth looking into Martianus’ description of Lady Dialectic, penned in the fifth century, and compare it to the comments that this description invited in the ninth century, and to the way it was illustrated in the tenth century. The description, comments and illustration of Lady Dialectic’s appearance, attire and attitude reveal how the benefits and risks of dialectical argumentation were assessed in different periods. </p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>The narrative frame that Martianus chose to introduce the liberal arts is a mythical assembly of gods. This is how he describes Lady Dialectic, the moment she enters the assembly:</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>….this woman entered, rather pale but very keen-sighted. Her eyes constantly darted about; her intricate coiffure seemed beautifully curled and bound together and descending by successive stages it encompassed the shape of her whole head [...] In her left hand she held a snake entwined in immense coils; in her right hand a set of patterns (premises) carefully inscribed on wax tablets […] was held on the inside by a hidden hook; but since her left hand kept de crafty device of the snake hidden under her cloak, her right hand was offered to one and all. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Then if anyone took one of those premises he was soon caught and dragged toward the poisonous coils of the hidden snake, which presently emerged and after first biting the man relentlessly with the venomous points of its sharp teeth, then gripped him in his many coils and compelled him to the intended position. If no one wanted to take the premises, Dialectic confronted them with some questions, or secretly stirred the snake to creep up on them until its tight embrace strangled those who were caught and compelled them to accept the will of their interrogator. - Martianus, <em>De nuptiis, </em>book IV, trans. Stahl, 107. This is a dangerous lady indeed, with deadly conversation skills. </p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="bnf790_132_v">

</div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Martianus says about Dialectic’s hairstyle that “her intricate coiffure seemed beautifully curled and bound together, and descending by successive stages, it encompassed the shape of her whole head”. The Latin clause ‘deducti per quosdam consequentes gradus’ (‘descending by successive stages’) is a reference to the successive steps of logical argumentation [ed. Stahl, 107]</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>John Scot’s interpretation of Dialectic’s tangled hairdo (<em>tortuose texti, nexi crines</em>) is rather negative: “Her premises for discussion (<em>propositiones</em>) are intricate, deceitful and seductive” (“Tortuose et fallaces et seductrices propositiones sunt”). [ed. Lutz, 264] Remigius of Auxerre’s comment is similar to John’s: “Intricate and interwoven hair stands for deceitful and seductive <em>propositiones. </em>(“Per tortuosos et nexiles crines significantur fallaces et seductrices propositiones”) [ed. Lutz, 1120]</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/dialecticahead.jpg"><figcaption>The illustrator depicts Dialectic with soft, flowing hair that does not look in the least tangled. A matter of fashion?<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Martianus wrote: “a set of patterns carefully inscribed on wax tablets […] was held on the inside by a hidden hook” Remigius of Auxerre commented: “The patterns indicate a simple premise for discussion. The hook however stands for an ensnaring conclusion” (“Per quas formulas simplex propositio intelligitur, per hamum vero captiosa conclusio”). [Lutz, 1122]</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Note how the illustrator has moved the hook from Dialectic’s right hand (where Martianus placed it) to her left. Perhaps he considered it impossible to hold wax tablets ánd a hook in one hand. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/dialecticahook.jpg"><figcaption>undefined<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Martianus describes how Dialectic held a serpent in her left hand, hidden under her cloak. John Scot interprets Dialectic’s serpent as a representation of sophistic arguments: “The serpent stands for the subtleties of sophisms” (“Per serpentem, sophisticas subtilitates intellige”)</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Sophistic argumentation stood for the dark side of dialectic. From a positive perspective, dialectic was a critical tool to distinguish true from false. Sophisms, that is clever but false arguments, used deliberately to deceive, were the object of distrust.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/dialecticasnake.jpg"><figcaption>The illustrator chose to present two snakes instead of one. Perhaps to increase the level of untrustworthiness?<br>Source: Gallica</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Let us look again at the illustration in full size. At first sight, the tenth-century illustrator follows Martianus’ description closely. We see Lady Dialectic holding a wax tablet with a handle. The lines written on it are illegible, but it is easy to imagine that these are the attractive premises for discussion to draw people near. The illustrator evidently has set the scene in a school context rather than in a mythical assembly of gods or in a fighting arena. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>The two young men are not depicted as formidable opponents, but as timid students. One of them is clenching a book. The wax tablet that Dialectic holds up for them to see underlines the school setting. A wax tablet with a handle was often used as a primer for study, displaying the alphabet or short religious texts or creeds. The object itself has not survived from the Middle Ages, but we know from descriptions and rare illustrations that they were in use in the classroom. The earliest surviving physical examples are of a much younger date (Kwakkel, 2018, 171-175)</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/hornbook.jpg"><figcaption>Hornbook Washington, Folger Shakespeare Library, STC 13813.6 (dated 1625)<br>Source: Folger Shakespeare Library</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>The image underscores that by the tenth century dialectic has entered the curriculum of monastic schools, although it was perhaps only studied by advanced students and scholars. The school setting does little to domesticate Dialectic’s intimidating character. Snakes still come out of her sleeve and she grabs the arm of one of the students with her hook.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="bnf790_133_rb">

In Christian discourse, Dialectic’s pet animal was associated with the treacherous charms of the devil-serpent in the Book of Genesis, who persuaded Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge, so she would be like God and know the distinction between good and evil (Gen. 3, 4) In a way, Dialectic’s promise is similar to that of the Old Testament serpent: with her help and instructions one learns to distinguish between true and false.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/adameve.jpg"><figcaption>El Escorial, Biblioteca del monasterio, cod. & II, 5, s. 10, f. 18r Beatus de Liébana, Commentary on the Apocalypse<br>Source: Biblioteca del monasterio</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>The serpent as symbol of heresy </h2><p>The treacherous nature of Dialectic’s serpent was also associated with the venom of heresy. Heretics, and particularly Arian heretics, were considered to be experts in dialectical disputations and false and misleading reasoning (Lim, 1995) Church father Ambrose (d. 397) contrasted the disputations of Arian heretics to the simple faith of Christians</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>“For they [the heretics] store up all the strength of their poisons in dialectical disputation, which by the judgment of philosophers is defined as having no power to build anything; it only aims at destruction. For it was not by dialectic that it pleased God to save his people. The kingdom of God resides in simplicity of faith, not in contention of words” Ambrose, <em>De fide </em>I, 5. Like Tertullian, Ambrose is worried that dialectic, the art of contention, will bring strife and discord to Christian communities</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/serpent.jpg"><figcaption>Lyon, BM 5128, f.269v Avignon, c.1350-1360 Decretum Gratianum<br>Source: Lyon</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>In this ninth-century manuscript of the chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine (d. 455) which recounts the history of the church up to the author’s own time, illustrations of snakes in the margin warn the reader that a heretic is about to enter the narrative. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In this section of the chronicle, marked with the symbol of the snake, Prosper recounts how the priest Arius preached that the Father, Son and the Holy Gost were not of the same nature, using Aristotle’s categorical logic to argue his point (see the text written next to the snake: <em>praedicans patrem et filium &amp; spiritum sanctum non esse unius eiusdemque naturae). </em>The use of the snake-symbol points to a close association between serpents and heretics, with their misleading tactics of persuasion.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">2</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/brussels.jpg"><figcaption>Brussels, KB 5169, fol. 42r.<br>Source: Copyright Brussels, Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Special Collections</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>The serpent became a regular feature of depictions, verbal or visual, of the female personfication of dialetic.

In fact, she needs both her hands to make a gesture of argumentation. Logic holds the index and middle finger of her right hand against the flat of her left hand. The position of the fingers signify the <em>propositio</em> and <em>assumptio</em> of syllogistic reasoning. One or two outstretched fingers signal that Logic has reached the end of her argumentation. Here, the attribute of the treacherous serpent has been replaced by a gesture of rational, step by step argumentation.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="admont">

In this poem, the art are competing for the crown of Mary. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Here we see logic wearing a crown. In her right hand she holds a dove, in her left hand a serpent.

Scorpions, dogs, hooks, doves and flowers express her positive and negative side and demonstrate her power to attract and to hurt. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>In this thirteenth-century manuscript of logical texts the inherent dualism that we have so far encountered in representations of dialectic has been resolved. Lady Dialectic is depicted as the virgin Mary. The serpent is not in her hand, but trampled under her feet. The beast still represents treacherous and seductive reasoning, but this time it is not Dialectic who employs it. To the contrary, it is she who conquers false and misleading arguments. The serpent has taken the position of the devil, the Old Serpent, who in traditional iconography is trampled under the feet of Christ</p></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/dialectica2.jpg"><figcaption>Dialectica looks positively saintly in this illustration.

As a result, the art was regarded with less distrust. This development is reflected  in the iconography of Lady Dialectic, who transformed from an untrustworthy, belligerent woman to the undisputed queen of the Trivium (who never quite lost her nasty streak). </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Distrust of dialectical argumentation did not completely disappear. It raised its head time and again, especially in the rhetoric of reformers who promoted a simple Christian faith away from the sophisticated dialectic of scholastics, who, to their minds, were forever disputing the nature of God. </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><div class="notes"><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> Plato, <em>Protagoras, </em>trans.: <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/protagoras.html">http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/protagoras.html</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p> See the blog of Evina Steinóva<em>: </em><a href="https://voicesfromtheedge.huygens.knaw.nl/?p=64">https://voicesfromtheedge.huygens.knaw.nl/?p=64</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-3"><p> <a href="https://www.elcamino.edu/faculty/eatherton/gothic.html">https://www.elcamino.edu/faculty/eatherton/gothic.html</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-3">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-4"><p> Alanus de Insulis, <em>Anticlaudianus, </em>III, 1, 345, PL 210, col. 509. <a href="#footnote-ref-4">↑</a></p></li></ol></div></div></div>
