      <div class="aoCol1"><h2>Rhetorica and dialectica: The art of speaking and reasoning well</h2><p>After a pupil had learnt how to read and write in Latin (<em>grammatica</em>), it was time for a next level knowledge of the language: learning how to speak well and effectively (<em>rhetorica</em>) and how to build arguments and <em>reason</em> well (<em>dialectica</em>). These skills were needed for many purposes: to speak well is an art needed to get your message across and to convince people, to be able to argue is important for a proper understanding of texts, for using them in debates and for deciding in cases of disagreement. <em>Dialectica </em>became a crucial element in theological debate (link to theme ‘debates’). It also became a key element of the university curriculum: every student was thoroughly trained in the skill of dialectical reasoning with the <em>disputatio</em>, a formal game of two opponents reasoning against each other.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/karlsruhef11v.jpg"><figcaption>In this image, Ramon Llull is engaged in a dialogue with Thomas Le Myésier.

Today we still have a remnant of the medieval practice in many universities all over the world: a public defense of one’s thesis.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Step 1: A problem is presented, posed as a yes or no question<br />Step 2: The questioner and the answerer pick a different side and present this as their thesis<br />Step 3: The questioner asks the answerer questions, posed as premises, which the answerer has to accept or deny. The questioner tries to trick the answerer in agreeing to certain premises that defy logic or common sense, and therefore force him to give up his thesis.<br />Step 4: the dialectical disputation ends when 1. the answerer is forced to compel his thesis, 2. the answerer destroys the questioners premise by pointing to a fallacy or <br />3. when the time is up (HORA EST!)</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure><img src="images/content/karlsruhef8r.jpg"><figcaption>Ramon Llull is disputing with the pope and cardinals at the pope’s court.<br>Source: BLB</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Rhetorica</p><p>Cicero’s <em>De Inventione </em>and the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>±a±m22±a±<em> </em>(unknown author but generally attributed to Cicero during the Middle Ages) are key texts for the study of rhetoric in the Middle Ages. Many manuscript copies of it survive, and in these books we can see that they were used for study and teaching, because of the notes and aids for reading and understanding the text that were added to them. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure><img src="images/content/herennium.jpg"><figcaption>Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 158, f. 73r (detail): Opening of Ad Herennium, here ascribed to Cicero, with a splendid dragon-adorned A.<br>Source: source</figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Dialectica and Logica</h2><p>The art of dialectic is the art of making a good argument, logic is the art of adhering to the rules of good reasoning, of making an argument that follows the rules of language and how language relates to the actual world. The two were, of course, closely linked to each other:  in order to make a convincing argument, it had to make sense: the person with which one entered into a debate over a certain point, would have to agree that the arguments are sound. For this reason these two arts were often treated in the same volume or text, or even as one and the same art. Logic, however, had its own set of curricular texts. The body of logical texts known and studied in the earlier Middle Ages is known as the <em>Logica Vetus</em>. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries new texts were added, known as the <em>Logica Nova</em>.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="bnf790_132_v">

</div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Logica Vetus</h2><p><em>Logica Vetus</em> (Old Logic) is the set of logical works that were in available in the libraries and book collections of medieval Europe from the start. Several works of Aristotle are at the heart of this set. The term distinguishes these works from those of the so-called <em>Logica </em>Nova, the new translations of Aristotle’s remaining logical treatises that came to the Latin West in the twelfth century.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>Many of the treatises of the <em>Logica Vetus </em>were made available by Boethius, who, in the late fifth/early sixth century made it his project to translate from Greek to Latin all the works of Plato and Aristotle and to provide commentaries on them. We have his translation of Aristotle's <em>Categories</em> and <em>On Interpretation</em>, and Porphyry’s  <em>Isagoge</em>. He also composed supplementary works, such as the <em>Book of Six Principles</em> and works about syllogisms, a crucial tool for logical reasoning.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>The texts of <em>Logica Vetus</em> played a major role in the formation of the discipline of dialectic and logic. They were studied from the early Middle Ages on, and remained in use in the times of the medieval universities.</p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Lady Dialectic is depicted in the middle of this image. Above her crown, the words ‘dialectica domina’ can be read. She holds a snake in her left hand to symbolize the treacherousness of logical reasoning. In her right hand she holds a Porphyrian tree, a classic illustration of the ‘scale of being’. At the top of the tree is the most abstract ‘substance’, at the bottom the most concrete ‘homo’ and (in this case) ‘deus’.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>At the top of the page, two philosophers are engaged in a dialectical argument, as their hand gestures show. On the left, Plato is seated, on the right his student Aristotle. On either side of Dialectic’s feet, two more philosophers are shown: Socrates (Plato’s teacher) on the left and ‘Magister Adam’ on the right.

Boethius had already translated many of the logical works of Aristotle, but not <em>Posterior Analytics.</em> With these new texts and commentaries and a new emphasis on Aristotle’s texts in the medieval university curriculum, fresh translations and commentaries flourished: William of Moerbeke, Thomas Aquinas, Robert Kilwardby and many other known and unknown medieval authors produced new commentaries. In the first decades of the 13th century, Aristotle’s works soon became the foundation of teaching in the Arts Faculties of Paris and Oxford. Logic became a fundamental subject, central to the programme of the university. Handbooks with collections of logical texts set out in a certain format testify to this.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="bnf178_69_r">

        <h1>Porphyry’s Isagoge</h1>
        <p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived.</p>
 <p>He became an important exponent of Neoplatonism. the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with the Platonic doctrine. </p>
        <p>Porphyry is best known for the Isagoge, an introduction to Aristotle's logical works that soon became an integral part of the Organon (the set of logical works of Aristotle) and one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum.	 </p>
 <p>The Isagoge is an elucidation to Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of.
        Taking a human for example, genus is “animal”, species “man”, difference “rational”, property “able to speak”, accident “white”. Porphyry’s Isagoge, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became widely influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least 1000 years.</p>
