        <div class="aoIntroTextCols"><div class="aoCol1Span"><h2><a id="_heading=h.46l4bv1o19sn"></a>Disputing in front of the king<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-0" id="footnote-ref-0">1</a></span></h2><p>In the last decade of the eighth century,  Hispanic and Frankish scholars became embroiled in a dispute over the nature of Christ. The immediate cause of the conflict were the teachings of Bishop Elipand of Toledo (d. 808), who, according to his opponents, taught that Christ was the adopted son of God. Elipand was supported in his beliefs by Felix, bishop of Urgell (d. 818), whose influence reached across the Pyrenees, into the southern part of the Frankish kingdom. The Frankish king, Charlemagne, who considered himself a guardian of orthodoxy, felt the need to eradicate these, in his opinion, heretical beliefs and asked his most prominent courtiers to respond. This part of the exhibition addresses the role of texts in the debate on adoptionism. Did the participants learn their techniques of argumentation from studying treatises on rhetoric and dialectic, or did their knowledge derive from elsewhere?</p></div></div></div><div class="aoCol1"></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><h2>Background of the controversy</h2><p>The teaching of the Hispanic bishops is usually referred to as  adoptionism, but this is actually a misnomer. The epithet goes back to a second-century sect, whose adherents held that God adopted the man Jesus as his son at the moment of his baptism. The label ‘adoptionism’  has been used since then to stigmatize different groups of Christians, who believed (or were thought to believe) that God the Father was superior to the Son. </p><p>A mosaic in the Arian baptistery in Ravenna, built around 500 by King Theoderic the Great, shows the baptism of Christ. The fact that Christ is depicted as a young and beardless man is meant to convey the Arian stance that Christ the Son is inferior to God the Father and not ‘of one substance’ with him. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/baptism.jpg"><figcaption>The baptism of Christ, Mosaic in the Baptistery of Ravenna, c. 500<br><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Baptism_of_Christ._Mosaic_in_Arian_Baptistry._Ravenna,_Italy.jpg" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Baptism_of_Christ._Mosaic_in_Arian_Baptistry._Ravenna,_Italy.jpg</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Elipand and Felix, however, did not teach that Christ was the adopted son of God. Rather, they held that Christ had adopted a human body when he became man. When they used the word ‘adopt’ they meant ‘accept’.  Yet for the Franks, the very word <em>adoptio</em> or <em>adoptivu</em>s set off alarm bells. It reminded them of heresies of the past. The conflict between the Frankish and Hispanic scholars ultimately sprang from a divergence between two cultural traditions. The theology and terminology of Elipand and Felix had grown from Hispanic conciliar traditions, in particular from the acts of the councils of Toledo.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">2</a></span> This manuscript from the tenth century (<em>Codex Aemilianense</em>, San Millán de la Cogolla, Biblioteca del Monasterio de El Escorial, D. I. I.) features an illustration that represents the Council of Toledo, or to be precise: it represents each Visigothic council held in Toledo in the sixth and seventh centuries.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/emilianensis.jpg"><figcaption>San Millán de la Cogolla, Biblioteca del Monasterio de El Escorial, D.

At this council the doctrine of Nestorius of Alexandria (d. c. 450) was examined and condemned. Nestorius was another teacher who had been labelled an adoptionist. In the eyes of the Franks, Elipand and Felix were reviving Nestorius’ heresy. Here we see an illustration representing the Council of Ephesus of 431 that condemned Nestorius. The illustration is part of a series depicting the early ecumenical councils in a canon law collection (Vercelli, Biblioteca Capitulare, ms. 165) dated to the late eighth or early ninth century. </p><p>The Council of Ephesus produced a dossier of texts that provided a source of inspiration for the Frankish disputants. They borrowed arguments against Nestorius from this dossier to combat their Hispanic opponents. Nestorius had made use of the language of <a href="about:blank">Aristotle’s categories</a> to define his doctrine. He had argued that Christ had two natures (<em>ousiae</em>), human and divine, which corresponded with two masks (<em>personae). </em>Since Frankish scholars interpreted the teaching of their Hispanic opponents through the lens of Nestorius’ teaching, Aristotelian language and logic also resonated in the eight-century debate on adoptionism. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/council3.jpg"><figcaption>Vercelli, Biblioteca Capitulare, ms. 165, late 8th, early 9th c., f. 4v.

At the council of Regensburg in 792, Felix was questioned by one of his most vociferous critics, Bishop Paulinus of Aquileia (d. 802). The assembly at Regensburg rejected and condemned Felix’s doctrine, and so did the council that was held two years later in Frankfurt. This illustration from the Utrecht Psalter (Utrecht, UL, Ms 32) dated to c. 820 is believed to represent the council of Frankfurt of 794. It has been suggested that the man in the middle, flanked by two other figures, is Felix of Urgell or his colleague Elipand of Toledo.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">3</a></span> </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/psalter.jpg"><figcaption>Utrecht, UB, Ms. 32, f. 90v (detail): Utrecht Psalter, c. 820.<br><a href="http://psalter.library.uu.nl/" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">http://psalter.library.uu.nl/</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>The council of Frankfurt that condemned Hispanic teaching is commemorated in the tenth-century <em>Chronicle of Moissac, </em>written in the Catalonian monastery of Rippol, some 150 kilometres to the north-east of Urgell, Felix’s territory.

On folio 48v, next to the entry to the year 794, a note in the margin says: “heresim elipanti toletane et felicis urgelletane episcopis (con?)uicta et erradicata”; “The heresy of bishops Elipand of Toledo and Felix of Urgell conquered(?) and eradicated”</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/rippol.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 4886 (11th c.), f. 48v (detail).

Once back in Urgell, Felix continued to teach his old doctrine. In 799, Charlemagne summoned Felix to his palace in Aachen, to engage in a public disputation with the court scholar <a href="/alcuin#alcuin">Alcuin of York</a> (d. 804), to settle the matter once and for all. This is a reconstruction of the palace at Aachen, where the debate was held, as archaeologists think it must have looked in the ninth century.</p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/aachenpalace.jpg"><figcaption>Reconstruction of the palace at Aachen in the 9th c.<br><a href="https://www.mozaweb.com/Extra-3D_scenes-Palace_of_Charlemagne_Aachen_9th_century-38645" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://www.mozaweb.com/Extra-3D_scenes-Palace_of_Charlemagne_Aachen_9th_century-38645</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Felix was an experienced debater. A text circulated in the Frankish realm (now lost) of a disputation Felix held with a Saracen.  In preparation of the disputation in Aachen, Alcuin consulted the Acts of the Council of Ephesus to find arguments against the teaching of Nestorius so he could use them against Felix. Manuscript Paris, BnF, lat. 1572 that was made in the eighth century and preserved in Tours, contains the Latin translation of the<em> Acts of the Council of Ephesus</em> that Alcuin consulted. According to  Bernhard Bischoff, Alcuin or his assistant wrote s’s and d’s in the margin to indicate which passages should be copied. The s stands for <em>scribe</em> (copy)  and the d for <em>dimitte </em>(stop).<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">4</a></span> The s’s and d’s are clearly visible here in the right margin of folio 79r. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/tours.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 1572 (8th c.), f. 79r (detail).

In manuscript Reims, BM, Bibliothèque de Carnegie, 1395, produced in the ninth or tenth century, the <em>Life of Alcuin </em>is part of a collection of martyrdom accounts (<em>passiones). </em>This is an interesting setting, seeing that Alcuin did not suffer a martyr’s death but died of old age.  Perhaps his role in fighting the adoptionist heresy made him a martyr in the eyes of the compiler. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/1395f91r.jpg"><figcaption>Reims, BM (Bibliothèque de Carnegie), ms. 1395 (Reims, 9th or 10th century), f. 91r (detail)<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8448987p" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8448987p</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>According to the anonymous author of the <em>Life of Alcuin, </em>the disputation between Felix and Alcuin lasted six days and took place before an audience of bishops, in the presence of King Charlemagne.

According to the author of the <em>Life of Alcuin</em>, Alcuin’s weapons were quotations from the Church Fathers. Felix was won over when Alcuin quoted from a letter of Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444), the main opponent of the heretic Nestorius. Alcuin had come across this letter in the dossier of the Council of Ephesus. Manuscript proof was brought to Felix, and when Felix read this quotation from Cyril, the author of the <em>Life </em>wrote, he burst out in tears and recanted his errors.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">6</a></span> Alcuin’s arsenal of dialectical weapons contained, however, more than quotations. Shortly after the debate in Aachen, Alcuin completed his <em>Seven Books Against Felix, </em>based on research he had undertaken in preparation for the disputation. This text offers us a glimpse of the type of argumentation that may have been employed during the disputation. Here we see a ninth-century manuscript from the Tours area (ms. Paris, BnF, lat. 2848) containing Alcuin’s <em>Seven Books against Felix. </em></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/tours2.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 2848, f. 1r. <br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b90659686" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b90659686</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Certain passages in the <em>Seven Books </em>indicate that both participants made use of <a href="about:blank">Aristotelian categorical logic</a>. Yet whereas Alcuin focussed on predicates that <em>are in</em> a subject, Felix appears to have taken the semantic approach, concentrating on predicates that can be <em>said of</em> a subject. To Alcuin’s mind Felix’s logic is inconsistent: </p><p>“‘True’ and ‘not true’ can in no way be one; thus ‘true son’ and ‘not true son’ may not both refer to one son; nor can ‘true God’ and ‘God nuncupative’ (i.e. God in name only) be one God [...] There is no way that both predicates can be in one <em>persona.</em>”<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">7</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>The terms <em>persona </em>and <em>natura </em>were central to Alcuin’s arguments against Felix. They were also key concepts in the debate on the teachings of Nestorius at the council of Ephesus, the council from which Alcuin drew inspiration. Also Boethius (d. 525) discussed <em>persona </em>and <em>natura </em>in his treatise against Nestorius, and his opponent Eutyches.</p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/philosophers.jpg"><figcaption>Avranches, Bibliothèque Municipale, Ms. 228 (manuscript made in Northern France (perhaps in Paris, ca 1225-1250), fol. 39r (detail): Two philosophers, probably Aristotle and Boethius, engaged in a discussion. <br><a href="http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/decor/34208" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">http://initiale.irht.cnrs.fr/decor/34208</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1Span"><p>The treatise against Nestorius is one of the five theological treatises of Boethius’ <em>Opuscula sacra. </em>The debate on adoptionism sparked an interest in Boethius’ theological treatises<em>. </em>No less than 14 manuscripts of the <em>opuscula sacra</em> have survived from the ninth century.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">8</a></span> The <em>opscula sacra </em>became important reference texts for scholars who were interested in dialectical argumentation as a means to combat heresy, such as Alcuin’s student Candidus.<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">9</a></span> </p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p><figure class="aorIllu"><img src="images/content/7730f43.jpg"><figcaption>Paris, BnF, lat. 7730 (Fleury (?), 9th century, Boethius, Contra Eutychen et Nestorium), f. 43rb (detail).<br><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8478988x" class="aorSourceLink"  target="_blank">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8478988x</a></figcaption></figure></p></div></div><div class="aoRow"><div class="aoCol1"><p>Another glimpse of the argumentation strategies Alcuin may have used during his disputation against Felix in Aachen, is offered in a letter he sent to ‘a noble virgin’ at Charlemagne’s court, who was probably Charlemagne’s relative <a href="about:blank">Gundrada</a>. In this letter, written shortly after debating Felix, he gave Gundrada instructions on how to conduct a disputation with a heretic, and offered to teach her the enquiries of the discipline of dialectic ("interrogationes  dialecticae disciplinae") or, loosely translated: the method of dialectical questioning. In manuscript Reims, BM, Bibliothèque Carnegie, 385, Alcuin’s letter to Gundrada follows directly on the profession of faith (<em>confessio) </em>of Alcuin’s opponent Felix (upper half of the page). This manuscript (made in the ninth century in the scriptorium of Reims) formed a dossier on adoptionism that was used as a reference file in another debate, which took place in the Frankish realm some 60 years later. </p></div><div class="aoCol2Span"><figure class="aorCompManuscript" id="c_reims">

This is one such example: </p><p>“One should ask whether every man that exists of a body and soul is a proper son of his father. If he says: yes, a proper son, then one should ask whether the soul proceeds from the father just like the flesh. If he says: no, then one should draw the inference: how is a man the proper son of his father if his soul does not proceed from the father, like the flesh?”<span class="aorNote"><a class="aorNoteA"  href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">10</a></span></p></div><div class="aoCol1"><p>The argumentation scheme that Alcuin presents here is based on the rules of inference.

Participants on both sides of the debate also made use of categorical logic and dialectical methods of enquiry. They acquired their knowledge from intermediate sources, such as the dossier of texts related to the Council of Ephesus or Boethius’ <em>Opuscula sacra</em>, rather than directly from the texts of the <em>logica vetus </em>or the <em>rhetorica vetus. </em>The study of these  texts, however, received a boost from the debate on adoptionism,  and from the doctrinal debates that followed soon after.
