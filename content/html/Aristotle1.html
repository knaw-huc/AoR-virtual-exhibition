<h2>Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em> and <em>On interpretation</em> in Latin translation<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup></h2><p>Aristotles’ <em>Categoriae </em>(“Categories”) and <em>De interpretatione </em>(“On interpretation”) constituted the central texts for the study of logic throughout the Middle Ages. The <em>Categories</em> and <em>On interpretation</em> were part of the <em>Organon </em>(“instrument”), the collection of Aristotle’s six logical works. For Aristotle logic is the instrument through which it is possible to come to an understanding of all things.<br />The word “category” means “predication”, the phenomenon that we can use words to express a truth about something else, for example: “Socrates is human”, or “Horses are animals”. The purpose of the <strong>categories</strong> was to create a system that could be used to describe everything in the world. Aristotle describes ten of these categories.<br />The Aristotelian categories can be considered as ten different kind of predicates or ways in which a predicate can be related to its subject. <strong>Predicates</strong> are terms that can only be universal: in “Socrates is human”, the predicate is the property of being human; in “horses are animals”, the predicate is the property of being an animal, etc. The ten categories, combined, can provide an explanation of what any individual thing is. <em>On interpretation</em> primarily deals with analyses of the basic elements of language and the nature of truth and falsehood. Its main concern is to discuss the relations of compatibility and incompatibility between <strong>propositions</strong>. A proposition is the most basic statement, a sentence that is complete and asserts something (e.g. Socrates is wise). The <a href="/trees#trees">square of opposition</a> was devised for examining the relation between different propositions. </p><p>[[[aristotleteaching.jpg]]]</p><p>Until the twelfth century, when more of the Aristotelian Corpus was made available in Latin because of a new influx of texts from the Greek and Arabic world, these works were known and circulated mainly in the Latin translations and commentaries written by <a href="/text-portraits.html?portait=Boethius2">Boethius</a>. Boethius was the channel through which Greek philosophical ideas were transmitted into the Latin tradition, and his commentaries on the <em>Categories</em> and <em>On interpretation</em>, together with Porphyry’s <em>Isagoge</em>, became a standard part of the logical curriculum. These texts were known as the <em>logica vetus</em>.</p><p>Sources used for this contribution:</p><ul><li>Studtmann, Paul, "Aristotle's Categories", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Fall 2018 Edition), Edward N.
