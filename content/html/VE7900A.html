<p>±col1±</p><h2>Martianus Capella and his allegorical encyclopaedia</h2><p>Martianus Capella is an author from Carthago, North Arfica, in the 5th century, a province of the Roman empire until the Vandals took over in 439 AD. Only one of his works survived: a work titled <em>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</em>, “About the marriage of Philology and Mercury”. In this work, the story is told about the god Mercury marrying the earthly maiden Philology, a personification of earthly knowledge and science. In this allegory, Mercury stands for the body of knowledge connected to <em>language</em>, or the <em>trivium</em>, Philology for the body of knowledge connected to <em>number</em>, or the <em>quadrivium</em>. Together, the couple personifies perfect knowledge. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>In the story, the couple receives a curious gift from the gods to celebrate their marriage: seven maidens come to present their knowledge at the banquet. The maidens are personifications of the seven Liberal Arts, the arts of the trivium and of the quadrivium. Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic are the three arts of language, Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy and Music are the four arts of number. For this exhibition, the author Martianus is crucial because he is one of the most important medieval sources for the establishment of the curriculum of the Seven Liberal Arts. Furthermore, especially his treatment of the art of Dialectic was elaborately commented upon.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[ladydialectica2.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Contents:<br />The contents of this book are a collection of texts that were typically used in schools, for an advanced introduction into the liberal arts and specifically the arts of language: plays by Terence, poetry by Horace and Lucan, Roman history and moral lessons by Lucan, an encyclopedia of the seven liberal arts by Martianus. On f. 27r Horace’s poetic works begin with a beautiful author’s portrait in the initial. On this page we see the main text, an introduction (accessus) to the author, a commentary in the right margin ánd extra notes in the left margin. A very full page indeed!<p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_27_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Yet on occasion, the users of this manuscript still felt that they ran out of space to add material, and added narrow slips in between the pages to get even more material into this collection.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-7900Af84r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here (f. 116r-v) you can see that the parchment used for this manuscript was not of the best quality: the natural edges of the skin are visible as the edges of the page. From the fact that the text carefully follows the edge of the page we can conclude that the page was not damaged, but that an ‘incomplete’ page was used in the quire.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_116_r_116_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Most of this book, in fact, was written on re-used parchment, as a palimpsest: parchment was already used for a text, but then scraped clean to make it usable again for a new text. In many of the pages the scraping or washing clean of the parchment left clear traces: the text that was originally on the page is still faintly visible, or the pages have been so rigorously scraped that it has become very thin. The scraping sometimes even caused holes in the parchment. <p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-7900Af26v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In more recent times, a chemical substance (re-agent) was applied to the page to make the underlying text visible. It did help initially, in fact, but it left ugly, permanent damage as the chemicals continued to react with the parchment and ink.<p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-7900Af44v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The book is thus humble in appearance, with very full pages and parchment that is not of a very high quality. Yet it does feature some simple but fanciful initials: here an E made with two peacocks, which is used to mark the beginning of a new section in Juvenal’s Satires on f. 109v. Juvenal’s Satires are a common schooltext in the Middle Ages: with this tekst students could practice their poetic metres (hexameters), learn about Roman history and were presented with moral lessons about society: three birds with one stone.<p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_109_v }}<p><br />±row±<br />±col1span±</p><p>Here you see the opening of Martianus Capella’s De nuptiis on f. 112r. Nota bene: the main text of Martianus Capella occupies the small column on the left. Its beginning is missing because the page is damaged. Perhaps the text started with a decorated initial that was cut out by a later dealer in manuscripts or manuscript’s pages. The wide column on the right is the commentary of Remigius. The commentary has become a solid block of text instead of a series of notes spread in the margin. </p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>It begins with an introduction to the work and its author: “Titulus iste quattuor nomina dat auctori suo” (The title gives four names to the author…). Here we find information about the author, his life and the content of his work. Such an introduction was called an accessus ad auctorem – “introduction to the author”. It was common practice to start a commentary with such an introduction.<p><p>±col2span±</p><p>±f±bnf790_112_r±f±<br /><br />±row±<br />±col1±<br />Simple decorated initials in animal style (f. 120v) mark the beginning of a new book, both for the main text (narrow column on the right) and for the commentary (wide column on the left). It is noteworthy that the pages are so full and the lay-out so cramped, that there is hardly a difference in the size of the letters used for the two categories of text.  This is an unusual feature: generally, the main text used a larger font and the commentary a smaller one.<p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_120_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On this page, the book on Grammar starts with a fanciful initial R (f. 128r). A dragon bearing a remarkably strong resemblance to a crocodile is tickled with a spear! Again, one can see here that the commentary text (column on the right) surpasses the main text (column on the left) in length considerably.<p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_128_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Portraits<br />This manuscript is particularly famous for its charming portraits of the liberal arts, depicted as wise ladies just as in Martianus Capella’s narrative. F. 127v: a portrait of ‘Lady Grammar’ teaching a class full of pupils. Grammar was the discipline of the trivium (the three arts of language of the seven liberal arts) which was taught at the basic level of education: in monasteries and cathedral schools, children were taught to read and write Latin, which was of crucial importance because it was the language of the bible, the liturgy and the church.<p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_127_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On f. 132v a full page illustration features a portrait of lady Dialectica (who speaks about her discipline in book IV of De nuptiis). Two students tentatively approach Lady Dialectica, who is armed with a hook (to reel in the two students on the right) and has snakes coming out of her sleeve (with which she attacks her opponents)! She is a dangerous lady.<p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_132_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Portrait of Lady Rhetoric on f. 140v and of Lady Astronomy on f. 151v.
