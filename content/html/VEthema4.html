<p>This exhibition showcases densely glossed, intensively studied treatises on rhetoric and dialectic. But how was theory applied in practice? This theme explores the role of rhetoric and dialectic in actual debates and controversies. It addresses
  questions such as who were allowed to participate, and how real (and fictional) disputations affected the social acceptance of the art of reasoning. </p>
