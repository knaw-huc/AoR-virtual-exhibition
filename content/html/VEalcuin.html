<p>±col1span±</p><p><strong>Alcuin and Dialogue</strong></p><p>Dialogue was a powerful tool in teaching, as Plato already showed in the dialogues of Socrates and his students: a student could ask his teacher questions, and thus learn from the master’s knowledge, or the teacher could ask his student questions, and thus check whether he had learned properly about the subjects at hand. A famous adopter of the dialogue as a teaching form is Alcuin of York (735−804), the well-known monk/abbot/bishop/teacher and scholar at the court of Charlemagne (742-814).</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[plato.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Alcuin of York very much identified as a teacher in his works. Among his didactic works are treatises on grammar, dialectic, dialogues (<em>disputationes</em>), a work on astronomy and a set of mathematical riddles for students. In his teaching, he showed a preference for the dialogue as the ideal form for his didactic texts: his introduction to the art of dialectic [link to RhetoricDialectic, slide 16 and ±a±cc±a±] is in the form of a dialogue between himself and Charlemagne, with Charlemagne asking questions and Alcuin answering. Here is a copy of Alcuin’s <em>Dialogus de dialectica</em> in manuscript Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm. 19437, which was made in the tenth, or early eleventh century in Tegernsee. On fol. 19v we see a portrait of Alcuin (on the left) and Charlemagne (on the right) disputing: “Disputat hic karolus rex albinusque magister”, “Here King Charles and master Albinus (which is a nickname of Alcuin) dispute”.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[alcuin.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In manuscript Leiden, UB, BPL 84 ±a±m84±a± several texts are found, and among them is Alcuin’s <em>Dialogue on Dialectica</em>. On this page, fol. 90r, the text opens: INCIPIT ARS DIALECTICA ALCHOINI PHILOSOPHI. AD KAROLUM MAGNUM; “The art of reasoning of Alcuin the Philosopher for Charlemagne begins.” Questions from Charlemagne are marked with K (Karolus), answers from Alcuin with A (Alcuin).</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[84f90r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here, on f. 90v, you can see how Alcuin patiently explains the art of dialectic, its terminology, its components and what you can do with it. In the terminology, one immediately recognizes the basic curricular texts on dialectic: Porphyry’s <em>Isagoge</em> [text portrait], Pseudo-Augustine’s <em>Categoriae Decem</em> [text portrait], Boethius’ treatises on syllogisms [text portrait], Cicero’s <em>Topica</em> [text portrait], et cetera. He illustrates with examples to make the dry text more lively.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl84_90_vb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Ch: How many species are there in dialectic?</p><p>A: The most important are 5: ‘isagogae’, categories, syllogistic formulas and definitions, ‘topica’, and ‘perermeniae’.</p><p>Ch: What are ‘isagogae’?</p><p>A: Isagoge is the (Greek) word for Latin ‘introductio’, ‘introduction’.</p><p>Ch: What does ‘introduction’ mean?</p><p>A: Introduction is …</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[84f90vfr.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Ch: What is ‘genus’?</p><p>A: ‘Genus’ is what can be divided into species: it describes whatever you are investigating in an inclusive word, such as ‘animal’.
