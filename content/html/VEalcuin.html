<p>±col1±</p><p>Dialogue was a powerful tool in teaching, as Plato already showed in the dialogues of Socrates and his students: a student could ask his teacher questions, and thus learn from the master’s knowledge, or the teacher could ask his student questions, and thus check whether he had learned properly about the subjects at hand. A famous adopter of the dialogue as a teaching form is Alcuin of York (735−804), the famous scholar at the court of Charlemagne (742-814).</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[plato.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Alcuin of York very much identified as a teacher in his works. Among his didactic works are treatises on grammar, dialectic, dialogues (<em>disputiationes</em>), a work on astronomy and a set of mathematical riddles for students. In his teaching, he showed a preference for the dialogue as the ideal form for his didactic texts: his introduction to the art of dialectic [link to RhetoricDialectic, slide 16 and ±a±cc±a±] is in the form of a dialogue between himself and Charlemagne, with Charlemagne asking questions and Alcuin answering.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[alcuin.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In our exhibition, we have Leiden, UB, BPL 84 ±a±m84±a±, which contains, among other things, Alcuin’s Dialogue on Dialectica</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl84_90_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here you can see how Alcuin patiently explains the art of dialectic, its terminology, its components and what you can do with it. In the terminology, one immediately recognizes the basic curricular texts on dialectic: Porphyry’s <em>Isagoge</em>, [portrait] Pseudo-Augustine’s <em>Categoriae Decem</em>, [portrait] Boethius’ treatises on syllogisms, Cicero’s <em>Topica</em>, etcetera [link to text portraits]. He illustrates with examples to make the dry text more lively.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl84_90_v }}<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> E.A.
