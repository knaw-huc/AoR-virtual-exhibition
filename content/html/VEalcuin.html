<p>±col1±</p><p>Dialogue was a powerful tool in teaching, as Plato already showed in the dialogues of Socrates and his students: a student could ask his teacher questions, and thus learn from the master’s knowledge, or the teacher could ask his student questions, and thus check whether he had learned properly about the topics at hand.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[plato.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Alcuin of York (735−804), the great scholar at the court of Charlemagne (742-814), very much identified as a teacher in his works. Among his didactic works are treatises on grammar, dialectic, dialogues (<em>disputiationes</em>), a work on astronomy and a set of mathematical riddles for students. In his teaching, he showed a preference for the dialogue as the ideal form for his didactic texts: his introduction to the art of dialectic is in the form of a dialogue between himself and Charlemagne, with Charlemagne asking questions and Alcuin answering.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[alcuin.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Meet Leiden, UB, BPL 84 ±a±bpl84±a±, which contains, among other things, Alcuin’s Dialogue on Dialectica</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl84_90_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here you can see how Alcuin patiently explains the art of dialectic, its terminology, its components and what you can do with it.
