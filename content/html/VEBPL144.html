<p>±col1±</p><p>The texts in this codex are not core texts for the arts of rhetoric and dialectic, but they illustrate these arts in practice: both authors present rich stories in a mix of prose and poetry, engaging with many of the principles of rhetoric and dialectic in their text. In the Consolation of Philosophy, lady Philosophy argues with the author, who has fallen on bad times, about the value and meaning of life. In Martianus’ De nuptiis, the story of Mercury’s marriage with Lady Philology shows how all the liberal arts contribute to an ultimate knowing of the universe. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>In this manuscript, wide margins are provided to allow ample commentary: a space for them has been marked off by vertical lines on either side of the text. The margin takes up as much as 70% of the page. A first, contemporary set of commentary texts have been copied in the prepared space around the text, but in addition a second, later layer (last quarter of the 13th century) has interacted with the text in a very lively and personal way, adding notes, drawings and peculiar attention signs.</p><p>±col3i±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_cover_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On this opening, we see some preliminary material on the left (f. 1v), and the beginning of Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy (f. 2r) on the right. This work, which was written part in poetry (opening lines on this page), part in prose (last six lines on this page) was very popular in medieval schools. It had beautiful poetry and prose ánd appropriate moral lessons: it could thus be used for the teaching of Latin grammar and style, ánd for moral education and philosophy. That the text was used for education, is clear from the lay-out of the page: it is such that enough marginal space is provided for commentary (70% of the page is margin!), and that notes could be added between the lines for a more detailed explanation of words, their grammatical form and their meaning.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_2_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>By looking closely at this page from the Martianus Capella part of the manuscript (f. 66v), one can see how a full grid of ruled lines was provided to write the dense lines of commentary. The ruling lines were created with a sharp point: a pattern of indented/ridged lines is the result.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_66_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Zooming in on this first page of the text, we see that not only the margin is extra wide, but also the space in between the lines, to house glosses. Interlinear glosses and marginal notes have been added to the text in a hand that matches the hand of the text. These can be dated to the last quarter of the 12th century. A second set of notes has also been added to the text. The type of script used in these suggests that they were written in the last quarter of the thirteenth century. The second annotator uses a personal style to comment on the text: faces, pointing hands, and nota signs draw attention to particular places on the page.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_2_rd }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The later hand interacts with the text in a more ‘personal’ way: he adds hands pointing to interesting passages in the text, brings in little sketches such as here the ‘Wheel of Fortune’: it illustrates the famous description of Boethius of the inevitable cycle of human fame and downfall: from the top to the bottom and up again.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_10_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Note that the two hands even have different ways of calling attention to certain elements in the text: they both use ‘Nota’ to signal important elements in the text, but in the original layer, the ‘Nota’ is written in a different way, and sometimes not written at all, but replaced with a head, a hand or even a foot (?)!</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_2_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>A selection of hands and other drawings calling attention to certain passages in the text </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144drawings }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On this page (f. 18r), two ‘talking heads’ are drawn, one of them wearing a ‘cappa’ or hat, the other not. Graduating from the medieval university involved a dress code: the new master was to wear a cappa, a certain cloak and certain shoes. So here, we could suggest that this is a drawing of a master and a student talking: the process of explaining the text, of understanding it by reading it together, is illustrated.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_18_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>We can see that the manuscript has been slightly cut, but perhaps these faces, hands and other pointers were deliberately close to the edge of the page so that passages pop out immediately when browsing through the manuscript.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>±m±144edges±m±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In the part of the book with Martianus Capella’s De nuptiis, the face of the page changes. Here (f. 57v-58r) there was such a large existing commentary to be copied on the page, that there was hardly any space for other material in the margins. The active and engaged look and feel of the annotated pages in the previous part shifts to a more passive look and feel: in this part, existing texts were studied, but not, on the fly, expanded with new thoughts and remarks.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_58_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy and Martianus’ De nuptiis do not have much in common concerning their contents, but their form is similar: they mix poetry and prose. That this was an important point of attration for the readers is testified by many notes concerning the analysis of the poetic metres used by the authors. Here, on an added page, a complete scheme of poetic metres has been drawn.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_83_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On occasion, later hands added other layers of notes to the text. Here (f. 85v-86r), for example, a hand added an extensive note in a very faded cursive hand, hardly legible anymore. Perhaps it is a draft of a new text, added in a space that was still empty. The writer used a dry pen or lead pencil.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_85_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The material state of this manuscript is not great. The text is executed with style and precision, but it was not written on top quality parchment. It was a functional book made for use and study, not for display.</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_58_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>At the very end of the book (f. 93v-94r), a single page has been added (upside down) from a different manuscript: it is a page dated to around 1100 with a fragment from Macrobius’ commentary on Cicero’s Dream of Scipio. The page is a loose leaf, but the theme of the text in fact matches the previous one: in Martianus the way in which the universe works, how the planets revolve in their paths around the earth, is explained, and in Macrobius too. That this was a point of interest for the 13th-century annotator is testified by tiny figures visualizing the different models, added to the text of Martianus (f. 90r).</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>±m±144cosmos±m±</p>
