<p>±col1±</p><p>Gerard D’Abbeville was a master of theology at the University of Paris and a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. Unlike his contemporaries, the Dominican Thomas Aquinas and the Fransiscan Bonaventure, Gerard was a secular master teaching at the University of Paris and did not belong to any of the new religious orders founded in the thirteenth century.’</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[paris.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>In the third quarter of the 13<sup>th</sup> century there arose a conflict at the University of Paris. Secular clerics opposed the teachers from Franciscan and Dominican mendicant orders. They quarreled about practical topics such as the right to occupy chairs in theology and theological questions such as the role of poverty within Christianity. Both sides –Aquinas and Bonaventure being on the side of the mendicants- published <em>quodlibeta</em> ( topics for or exercises in philosophical or theological discussion) to underline their points. It was Abbeville who rekindled the fire of the debates in 1269 by attacking the mendicant order in a sermon and a quodlibet during Lent. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Library of Sorbonne</h2><p>Gerard was a friend and colleague of Robert de Sorbon, who founded the college of the Sorbonne in 1253. Gerard’s commitment to the institution is evident from his will (1272). He bequeathed the library about 300 manuscripts, doubling the existing collection of the college. Libraries in this period were frequently built up by private donation, but the scale of Gerard’s donation is impressive.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[books.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In his will Gerard stipulated that his books – mainly theological works, but also philosophical and medical manuscripts – could be freely used at the Sorbonne by all <em>secular</em> students and masters, subtly excluding access to them by his old sparring partners, the members of the mendicant orders. The religious orders, he commented, already had enough. As well as the books, Gerard donated his book cupboard (<em>armarium</em>) and three of his ‘best chests’ to store the library, insisting that the collection was to be inspected yearly and inventorised. Gerard’s stipulations hint at the formalisation of institutional library practices in this period.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[chainedbook.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Where did Gerard get his books?</h2><p>Many of Gerard’s books belonged to Richard de Fournival (d. 1260), a thirteenth-century poet, medic and  astrologer who was Chancellor at the cathedral in Amiens. Richard wrote a catalogue of his books, <em>Biblionomia</em> (now Paris, Bibliothèque de Sorbonne, MS 636, which classified his manuscripts by subject), listing titles which were ‘must haves’ for medieval scholars. These included key works of rhetoric and dialectic: of Aristotle, Boethius, and Cicero, but also of the Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali (c. 1056-111) and the Spanish philosopher and translator of Arabic works, Dominicus Gundissalinus (c. 1115-90). </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_1_r_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Richard’s collection also included older manuscripts, which were then passed on through Gerard into the Sorbonne’s collection.

However, Gerard clearly valued his collection of theological manuscripts far above his ‘philosophical’ works, advising in his will that his medical and philosophical works could be sold if needed to settle his debts!
