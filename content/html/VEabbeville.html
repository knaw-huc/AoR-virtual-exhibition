<p>±col1±</p><p>Gerard d’Abbeville was a secular master of theology at the University of Paris. Unlike his contemporaries, the Dominican Thomas Aquinas and the Franciscan Bonaventure, Gerard did not belong to any of the new religious orders founded in the thirteenth century.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[paris.jpg]]]</p>±meta±<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In the mid-thirteenth century, conflicts arose at the newly formed University of Paris between secular masters (like Gerard) and teachers from the Franciscan and Dominican orders. These conflicts concerned practical issues – such as  competing claims to students and positions of privilege – as well as theological matters, such as the spiritual value of personal poverty. Both sides published <em>quodlibeta, </em> records of disputations made in question-and-answer format. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>In 1269 Gerard held a <em>quodlibet </em>claiming that archdeacons and parish priests were in a higher state of spiritual perfection than members of religious orders. Gerard’s views were criticised by the Dominican Thomas Aquinas in his <em>De perfectione spiritualis vitae </em>(1269-70). This exchange illustrates the lively atmosphere of scholarly debate in Paris in this period. Eighteen <em>quodlibeta</em> of Gerard survive, a record!</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[702.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Library of Sorbonne</h2><p>Gerard was a friend and colleague of Robert de Sorbon, who founded the college of the Sorbonne in 1253. Gerard’s commitment to the institution is evident from his will (1272). He bequeathed the library about 300 manuscripts, doubling the existing collection of the college. Libraries in this period were frequently built up by private donation, but the scale of Gerard’s donation is impressive.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[sorbonne.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In his will Gerard stipulated that his books – mainly theological works, but also philosophical and medical manuscripts – could be freely used at the Sorbonne by all <em>secular</em> students and masters, subtly excluding access to them by his old sparring partners, the members of the mendicant orders. The religious orders, he commented, already had enough.As well as the books, Gerard donated his book cupboard (<em>armarium</em>) and three of his ‘best chests’ to store the library, insisting that the collection was to be inspected yearly and inventorised. Gerard’s stipulations hint at the formalisation of institutional library practices in this period.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[chainedbook.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Where did Gerard get his books?</h2><p>Many of Gerard’s books belonged to Richard de Fournival (d. 1260), a thirteenth-century poet, medic and  astrologer who was Chancellor at the cathedral in Amiens. Richard wrote a catalogue of his books, <em>Biblionomia</em> (now Paris, Bibliothèque de Sorbonne, MS 636), which classified his manuscripts by subject, listing titles which were ‘must haves’ for medieval scholars. These included key works of rhetoric and dialectic: of Aristotle, Boethius, and Cicero, but also of the Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali (c. 1056-1111) and the Spanish philosopher and translator of Arabic works, Dominicus Gundissalinus (c. 1115-90). </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_1_r_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Richard’s collection also included older manuscripts, which were then passed on through Gerard into the Sorbonne’s collection.

However, Gerard clearly valued his collection of theological manuscripts far above his ‘philosophical’ works, advising in his will that his medical and philosophical works could be sold if needed to settle his debts!
