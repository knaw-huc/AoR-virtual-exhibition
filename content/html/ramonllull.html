<p><strong>Ramon Llull</strong></p><p>Ramon Llull (c.1232-1315) was born in Majorca. He worked as a tutor for James II of Aragon and although he was married and had two children he lived a “dissolute” life. One night, while he was writing a (vulgar) poem to a woman, he had a vision of Jesus hanging on the cross. Ramon realised, as he recalls in his Vita Coaetanea, that God wanted him to abandon his wife and children to fully commit his life to serve Christ.</p><p>[[[92f1v.jpg]]]</p><p>Ramon sold his possessions, undertook several pilgrimages and became a member of the Friars Minor. He believed that God wanted him to compose the “best book in the world against errors of the infidels” and convert Muslims and Jews to Christianity. When he was back in Majorca he bought a Muslim slave to teach him the Arabic language. For nine years Ramon studied philosophy and theology in both Latin and Arabic. </p><p>[[[92f3v.jpg]]]</p><p>Meet Breviculum ex artibus Raimundi Lulli electum - St. Peter perg. 92</p><p>[[[92cover.jpg]]]</p><p>This manuscript contains several miniatures that depict the life of Ramon Llull like a comic book</p><p>[[[92f10r.jpg]]]</p><p>F.7r shows  symbolic Llull commanding an army of knights with reinforcements to repel the enemy and tear down the Tower of Falsehood and Ignorance. In this image, the army is preceded by three trumpeters who signify the three powers of the soul: The intellect, memory and will. </p><p>[[[92f7r.jpg]]]</p><p>In 1305 Ramon published his most famous work; the Ars Magna. In this book Ramon tried to convert people to Christianity by using logic, reason and dialectics. The reader was encouraged to use diagrams, schemes and other visual aids to answer theological questions. “It was the earliest attempt in the history of formal logic to employ geometrical diagrams for the purpose of discovering nonmathematical truths, and the first attempt to use a mechanical device a kind of primitive logic machine to facilitate the operation of a logic system. “(Gardner 1)</p><p>[[[lampje.jpg]]]</p><p>Vanaf hier klad (hulp Irene O’D nodig)</p><p>“Llull's systems of organizing concepts using devices such as trees, ladders, and wheels, have been analyzed as classification systems.”</p>
