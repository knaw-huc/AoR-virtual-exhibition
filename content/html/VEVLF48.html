<p>±col1span±</p><p>In this ninth-century manuscript made in Northeastern France, we find Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii </em>(On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury) [link to text portrait]. Around the text of Martianus, a large commentary has been copied in several hands. The scribes who wrote the commentary use all kinds of high-end scribal techniques, such as <em>Tironian notes </em>(an ancient and medieval type of <em>shorthand script</em>), diagrams, reference signs and musical notation. It is a very good example of a scribal culture of the region of Auxerre, Rheims and Fleury in that period: a culture in which ancient and late ancient authors were studied with zeal, connected to one another and contrasted with each other.</p><p>±col3i±</p>±meta±<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>From the first page of the text on, it is striking how densely annotated it is: a large column has been created on both sides of the text to accomodate commentary and glosses, and in between the lines of the main text, much of the available space has been used for glosses too. Even around this space allocated for commentary, however, more notes have been added in the inner and outer margins, at the top and at the bottom of the page. Note also, in the bottom margin, the old stamp of the University of Leiden (Academia Lugdunensis), and the piece of paper stating that this book was ‘from the libary of the illuster Isaac Vossius’,  and once had the number 64.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_1_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The book was probably written in Auxerre. We think this because of the how the letters are shaped. What we know of learned culture in Auxerre also fits the profile of this manuscript. Further evidence is this note in the margins of f. 50v, smack in the middle of the manuscript, from the bottom up and then into the upper margin: “HUNC LIBRUM DEDIT HELISEUS ARCHIDIACONUS SANCTO GERMANO PRO VITA ETERNA” (“Archdeacon Heliseus gave this book to Saint Germain for eternal life”)</p><p>The archdeacon Heliseus can be identified as a Heliseus from St. Stephen’s cathedral in Auxerre, and Saint Germain as the abbey of Saint Germain in Auxerre.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_50_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Leiden, UB, VLF 48, detail of f. 2r</h2><p>The long text in the red is a short introduction to the author and his work, a so-called <em>accessus</em>. It tells us who the author is, where he was born, what the work in this book is about, and why the author has written it. In the green box we can see in capital letters the title of the work: “From Martianus Mineus Felix Capella from Carthago, Arfica, <em>On the marriage of Philology</em>.” A marginal note continues: “TWO BOOKS (that is: the first two books of <em>De nuptiis</em> that tell the story of the marriage). ON THE ART OF GRAMMAR: 1 (book), (a sign references to the continuation of this gloss above:) ON DIALECTIC 1 (book), ON RHETORIC 1 (book), ON GEOMETRY 1 (book), ON ARITHMETIC 1 (book), ON ASTRONOMY 1(book), ON MUSIC 1 (book).”</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_2_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The commentary has been written in several hands. Some of them were written at approximately the same time as the main text. They were part of the original design of the book: always meant to be included. Others are additions from later readers. Here we see the three contemporary hands on the opening page: hand 1 (green boxes) and hand 2 (blue boxes), distinguished mainly by the colour of their ink, write in the area originally prepared for commentary. Hand 3 (red boxes) wrote extra notes in the space still available at the edges of the page.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_2_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>At the end of this gloss (see green box), we see signs that are not letters, but <em>Tironian signs</em>, signs from the shorthand alphabet used in especially the early middle ages for writing at dictation speed, writing in tight spots or for more personal, unfinished drafts. They are a sign of a literacy at the highest level. The note reads: “<em>etiam dicitur. apo toy clitos quia ipse est advocatus nominum</em>”<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> In the red box we see the hand of a fourth, later scribe adding notes in the margin: it is the hand of Ratherius of Verona, a monk, teacher, bishop and (887/890 – 974 AD). He picked up extraordinary words from the text of Martianus, and repeated them in the margin, presumably to add them to his own, notoriously rich vocabulary.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Zooming in really close, we can see how one of the contemporary scribes used <em>Tironian notes</em> to make the text fit in the limited space he had. <em>Tironian notes</em>, so-called after their supposed inventor, Cicero’s slave and right hand Tiro, are a shorthand alphabet. In the early middle ages the Tironian notes were used for writing at dictation speed, writing in tight spots or for more personal, unfinished drafts. They are a sign of a litteracy at the highest level. This note on f. 4v reads: “<em>etiam dicitur. apo toy clitos quia ipse est advocatus nominum</em>” (See S.

Here is an example found on f. 4v. It is the hand of Ratherius of Verona, a monk, teacher, bishop and (887/890 – 974 AD). He picked up extraordinary words from the text of Martianus, and repeated them in the margin, presumably to add them to his own, notoriously rich vocabulary. (C.

Here we find a figure explaining how a being of one category differs from that in another because they do not share a certain quality [link to O’Daly, Diagrams I, slide 20]: HOMO (= man) in the centre, differes from LAPIS (= stone) on the top, because it does not share the quality of <em>animalitas</em> (living); it differs from EQUUS (= horse), because it does not share the quality of <em>ratio</em> (the ability to think); it differs from ARBOR (= tree), because it does not share the quality of <em>sensus</em> (feeling); it differs from ANGELUS (= angel), because it does not share the quality of <em>mortalitas </em>(the ability to die). This whole explanation is compacted into one figure of barely 25 mm in diameter!</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_32_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>These figures or diagrams are a good source to see the dynamics of texts in the world of manuscripts: they travel from one context to another or are sometimes copied separately as aids to reading and understanding. On the last leaves of this manuscript, for example, a set of planetary diagrams, illustrating the way in which the planets travel around the earth in the cosmos, is copied (f. 92v, detail). The diagram presents Martianus’s explanation of how the planets revolve, but also the explanations of others, notably Bede and Pliny. It is found in other manuscripts as well. <sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_92_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In fact, the <em>collecting </em>of different authorities on certain topics is one of the main aims of the commentary. In many places it can be seen how other names are referenced to get to more, better or contrasting information. These references range from relatively specific (Augustine in his <em>De doctrina christiana</em>, or Pliny in his <em>Naturalis historia</em>) to very vague: “alii” (others), “philosophi” (philosophers). It is then up to us to find the sources of these pieces of information! </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bubbels }}<p><a id="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a></p><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> See S.
