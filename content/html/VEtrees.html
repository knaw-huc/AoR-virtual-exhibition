<p>±col1±</p><h2>Common Schematic Forms: The Square of Opposition</h2><p>The square of opposition<strong> </strong>is a common diagram found in medieval dialectical manuscripts and is used to relate propositions to each other.  It’s a sort of argument-tester which allows one to identify logical fallacies. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>A proposition consists of a subject and a predicate linked with a verb (cupola). For example: “All horses (subject) are (cupola) animals (predicate)” This is a affirmative proposition. A negative proposition includes a form of negation, for example: ‘No horses are animals’.  </p><p>±col3i±</p><p>Propositions also vary in quantity. They can be universal, particular, indefinite or singular. ‘All horses are animals’ is a universal affirmative proposition. ‘Some horses are not animals’, is a particular, negative proposition (and false!)</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>We don’t know precisely who the first person to relate propositions in the form of a ‘square of opposition’ was, but the earliest examples are found in copies of the second-century AD logician Apuleius’s <em>Peri hermeneias</em>. Let’shave a look at the square of opposition in <strong>BPL 25, f. 12r.</strong> In this example the proposition under examination is ‘All men are just’, ‘<em>Omnis homo iustus est</em>’</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl25_12_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Buridan’s Octagon of Opposition</h2><p>A particularly elaborated version of the square of opposition is found in Jean Buridan’s (c. 1301-60) <em>Summulae de Dialectica. </em>Known as an ‘octagon of opposition’, Buridan – teacher at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Paris – amended the traditional square to also incorporate modal syllogisms. A modal syllogism is one that uses the words ‘necessarily’, ‘possibly’, or ‘contingently’. For example, ‘just possibly applies to some men’, ‘just necessarily applies to no men’. By incorporating these extra sets of syllogisms, Buridan extended the number of relations which were possible in the traditional square. The octagon is only present in some of the manuscripts of the <em>Summulae,</em> so it may not have been an authorial addition, but it clearly would have been a useful addition for students grappling with complex logical propositions.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[14756.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Common Schematic Forms: The Porphyrian Tree</h2><p>In the <em>Categories</em>, Aristotle identifies ten categories (in Latin ‘<em>praedicamenta’</em>) which can be used to describe everything in the world</p><p>Substance (e.g. a man, the <em>species</em> man, the <em>genus</em> animal) </p><p>Quantity (e.g. line, number)</p><p>Relation (e.g. larger)</p><p>Quality (e.g. sweetness)</p><p>Doing (e.g. cooling)</p><p>Undergoing (e.g. being cooled)</p><p>Place (e.g. in the market square)</p><p>Time (e.g. yesterday)</p><p>Position (e.g. sitting)</p><p>Having (e.g having shoes on)</p><p>±col2±</p><p>The first category, substance, describes <em>what</em> something is, what is its being (e.g. ‘Socrates is a man’; being a man is fundamental to the essence of what it is to be Socrates). The remaining categories are ‘accidents’, these are the properties of the substance, they describe <em>how </em>something is, properties which are not necessarily essential to <em>what</em> it is (e.g. ‘Socrates is sitting’; Socrates could equally be standing, but he would still be Socrates).</p><p>±col3±</p><p>Porphyry, a third-century Greek philosopher, wrote an important work called the <em>Isagoge</em>, which was an introduction to Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em>. This work was later translated into Latin and commented upon by Boethius. One of the important contributions of this work was a treatment of the first, and most important of Aristotle’s categories, substance. Porphyry investigated what substance consisted of by using *<em>differentiae</em> – looking at the essential features which distinguish one *<em>species</em> within a *<em>genus</em> from another. This process of distinguishing between genera was often visualised in medieval manuscripts in the form of a tree diagram.</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The <strong>‘Porphyrian tree’ </strong>is a schematic tool to divide a category, genus, into its constituents, and in so doing work out what the sub-genera and species which make up this category consist of. It is a tool for thinking about what things are and working out the essential characteristics of particular species.</p><p>±col2±</p><p><em>Why is it called the “Porphyrian” Tree?</em> Although there is no evidence that Porphyry himself came up with this schematic device, it’s most commonly associated with manuscripts of his <em>Isagoge.</em></p><p>±col3±</p><p>_±f±ein315_53_±f±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>The Tree involves using <em>‘differentiae</em>’, points of distinction, to evaluate what a substance is. Here the tree is worked out to a particular conclusion, to identify the characteristics of a human. Starting from the top, we establish that we are dealing with a corporeal substance, which is animate, capable of sensation, rational and mortal. These are the characteristics of a human being, exemplified here by the philosophers Socrates, Cicero and Plato.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Substance: corporeal / incorporeal<br />Corporeal: animate / inanimate<br />Animate: sensate / insensate<br />Animal: rational / irrational<br />Rational animal: mortal / immortal<br />Man: Socrates / Cicero / Plato</p><p>±col3±</p><p>_±f±ein315_53_b±f±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2><strong>Applications</strong></h2><p>We can use the Tree to identify features of other substances. For example, using this terminology we could describe a dog as a corporeal, animate, sensate, irrational substance. A flower is a corporeal, animate, insensate, substance. A rock is an incorporeal, inanimate substance. The Porphyrian Tree permits the user to identify the essential characteristics of everything in the world. It’s important to note that all of Aristotle’s categories could be expanded into ‘trees’ using the process of differentiation, but the category of substance was the one which was most commonly executed.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>The ‘Porphyrian tree’ was co-opted into different textual contexts. For example, in this example, a version of the Porphyrian tree is incorporated into a thirteenth-century manuscript of John of Damascus’ <em>Logica. </em>This manuscript was donated to the library at the Sorbonne by <strong>Gerard d’Abbeville</strong>±a±2ab±a±, a thirteenth-century master. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf165_37_r }}<p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In this twelfth-century manuscript of Boethius’ commentary on the <em>Topica</em> of Cicero a glossator has added a small schemes similar to a Porphyrian tree beside the discussion of species and genus in the text. The scheme, entitled ‘<em>substantia</em>’ (substance) gives the genera: substance, body animate, animal, man and ends with the example of Socrates. Here Porphyry’s tree is transported from its original textual context and used in an abbreviated form – presumably to help the reader recall the method of logical differentiation.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf770_52_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Why is it called a ‘tree’?<br />Although the Porphyrian Tree is read from top to bottom, the similarity between its branching form and a tree was not lost on medieval scribes. Over time the diagram was often decorated to resemble a tree. In this manuscript, a copy of Decem categoriae, a text on the categories attributed in the medieval period to Augustine, a branching diagram similar to a Porphyrian tree has been added in the margin, complete with foliate details.</h2><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_24_vb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The tradition of referring to the ’Porphyrian tree’ explicitly as a tree can be traced back to the thirteenth century. The famous logical text book, <em>Summulae logicales</em> by Peter of Spain, referred to ‘<em>arbor Porphyriana’ </em>and copies of the text were frequently illustrated with depictions of the Porphyrian tree as a tree – complete with leaves and branches. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>In this elaborate example (which like BnF lat. 16598 was also part of the bequest of <strong>Gerard d’Abbeville </strong>±a±2ab±a±, to the library of the Sorbonne in the thirteenth century) we can see that the diagram is replete with foliate detailing, with ‘<em>homo’, </em>man, placed at the root of the tree.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[16611.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The Porphyrian tree was just one example of how medieval scholars grappled with thinking about the nature of being. In these two copies of Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis philologiae et mercurii </em>±a±m88±a±, <strong> </strong>a small marginal diagram is appended to the section on dialectic. Circular in form, at its centre it has the  word ‘homo’, ‘man’ then <em>‘animalitas’, ‘ratio’, ‘mortalitas’, ‘sensus’ </em>– animality (i.e. being animate), reason, mortality and senstation – in the next circle. In the outermost circle we find the words <em>‘lapis’ </em>(stone); ‘<em>equus’ </em>(horse); <em>‘arbor</em>’ (tree) and ‘<em>angelus</em>’ (angel). </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Starting in the centre and reading outwards one can conclude the following:<br />- that man differs from a stone as he is animate<br />- that man differs from a horse as he has reason<br />- that man differs from a tree as he can feel<br />- that man differs from an angel as he is mortal</p><p>±col3±</p>{{> folios/folio-circlediagram }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>This scheme, inserted on a slip into a copy of the <em>De decem categoriae</em> also tackles the subject of substance (here termed <em>oycia</em>, a Latinised form of οὐσία and described as the <em>‘genus generalissimum</em>’, the genus of all genera) The left side of the scheme deals with the genus 'tree’, giving the example of a nut-bearing tree as a species of this genus. The right hand side of the scheme deals with the genus ‘stone’, giving the precious stone beryl as a species of this genus. The central branch of the scheme deals with the the genus ‘animal’, with ‘man’ (again Cicero) given as the example of the species. Animal, tree and stones are all types of substance but are each have different distinguishing qualities.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_27_bisr }}<p>±col3±</p>
