<p>±col1span±</p><h2>Propositions<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup></h2><p>A proposition consists of a subject and a predicate linked with a verb (cupola). For example, the sentence “all horses are animals” can be broken down into the following components: “All horses (subject) are (cupola) animals (predicate)” This is an affirmative proposition. A negative proposition includes a form of negation, such as the word “no”. For example: “No horses are animals”. Propositions also vary in quantity. They can be universal, particular, indefinite or singular. “All horses are animals” is a universal affirmative proposition. “Some horses are not animals”, is a particular, negative proposition (and false!).</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2><a id="bookmark=id.30j0zll"></a>The Square of Opposition</h2><p>The square of opposition<strong> </strong>is a common diagram found in medieval dialectical manuscripts and is used to relate propositions to each other. It’s a sort of argument-tester which allows one to identify logical fallacies. We don’t know precisely who the first person to relate propositions in the form of a ‘square of opposition’ was, but the earliest examples are found in copies of the <em>Peri hermeneias</em>, a second-century text by the logician <a href="file:///C:\text-portraits.html?portait=Apuleius">Apuleius.</a> In this square of opposition found in <a href="http://bpl25#bpl25">Leiden, UB, BPL 25</a> (f. 12r), a copy of the <em>Peri hermeneias</em>, the proposition under examination is “All men are just”, “<em>Omnis homo iustus est</em>”.

A modal <a href="http://syllogism#syllogism">syllogism</a> is one that uses the words ‘necessarily’, ‘possibly’, or ‘contingently’. For example, ‘just possibly applies to some men’, ‘just necessarily applies to no men’. By incorporating these extra sets of syllogisms, Buridan extended the number of relations which were possible in the traditional square. The octagon is only present in some of the manuscripts of the <em>Summulae,</em> so it may not have been an authorial addition, but it clearly was a useful addition for students grappling with more complex logical propositions.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[14756.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Categories</h2><p>In the <a href="file:///C:\text-portraits.html?portait=Aristotle1"><em>Categories</em></a>, Aristotle identifies ten categories (in Latin ‘<em>praedicamenta’</em>) which can be used to describe everything in the world:</p><p>Substance (e.g. a man, the <em>species</em> man, the <em>genus</em> animal) <br />Quantity (e.g. line, number)<br />Relation (e.g. larger)<br />Quality (e.g. sweetness)<br />Doing (e.g. cooling)<br />Undergoing (e.g. being cooled)<br />Place (e.g. in the market square)<br />Time (e.g. yesterday)<br />Position (e.g. sitting)<br />Having (e.g having shoes on)</p><p>±col2±</p><p>The first category, substance, describes <em>what</em> something is, what is its being (e.g. ‘Socrates is a man’; being a man is fundamental to the essence of what it is to be Socrates). The remaining categories are ‘accidents’, these are the properties of the substance, they describe <em>how </em>something is, properties which are not necessarily essential to <em>what</em> it is (e.g. ‘Socrates is sitting’; Socrates could equally be standing, but he would still be Socrates).</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[socrates.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2><a id="bookmark=id.2et92p0"></a>The ‘Porphyrian Tree’</h2><p><a href="file:///C:\text-portraits.html?portait=Porphyry">Porphyry</a>, a third-century Greek philosopher, wrote the <em>Isagoge</em>, an introduction to Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em>. This work was later translated into Latin and commented upon by <a href="file:///C:\text-portraits.html?portait=Boethius2">Boethius</a>. One of the key contributions of this work was a treatment of the first, and most important, of Aristotle’s categories – substance. Porphyry investigated what substance consisted of by using <em>differentiae</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> – looking at the essential features which distinguished one <em>species</em> within a <em>genus</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup></sup> from another. This process of distinguishing between genera was often visualised in medieval manuscripts in the form of a tree diagram. The ‘Porphyrian tree’<strong> </strong>is a schematic tool used to divide a category, genus, into its constituents, and in so doing work out what the sub-genera and species which make up this category consist of. It is a tool for thinking about what things are and so working out the essential characteristics of particular species. Although there is no evidence that Porphyry himself came up with this schematic device, it’s most commonly associated with manuscripts of his <em>Isagoge.</em></p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The Tree uses <em>‘differentiae</em>’, points of distinction, to evaluate what a substance is. In this <a href="http://cod315#ein315">manuscript</a> of the <em>Isagoge</em> (Einsiedeln, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod. 315 (605)) the tree is worked out to a particular conclusion, to identify the characteristics of a human being. Starting from the top, we establish that we are dealing with a corporeal substance, which is animate, capable of sensation, rational and mortal. The examples provided here of ‘human beings’ are the philosophers Socrates, Cicero and Plato.</p><p>Substance: corporeal / incorporeal<br />Corporeal: animate / inanimate<br />Animate: sensate / insensate<br />Animal: rational / irrational<br />Rational animal: mortal / immortal<br />Man: Socrates / Cicero / Plato</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_53_b }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>We can use the Tree to identify features of other substances. For example, using this same terminology we could describe a dog as a corporeal, animate, sensate, irrational substance. A flower is a corporeal, animate, insensate, substance. A rock is an incorporeal, inanimate substance. The Porphyrian tree permits the user to identify the essential characteristics of everything in the world. All of Aristotle’s categories could be expanded into ‘trees’ using the same process of differentiation, but the category of substance was the one which was most commonly described in this form.</p><p>±col3±</p><p></p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>In this version of the Porphyrian tree the examples given of ‘<em>homo’, </em>‘man’,<em> </em>at the bottom of the tree are Plato, Cato, and Cicero.

Cicero’s signified rhetoric, while Cato’s <em>Distachs</em> was a widely-used elementary textbook for learning Latin, and so evoked the art of grammar.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[ein28.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p><a id="bookmark=id.1fob9te"></a>The Porphyrian tree was co-opted into different textual contexts.
