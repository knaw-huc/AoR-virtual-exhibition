From the Faculty of Arts they could progress to the Faculties of Theology, Law or Medicine. [link to DialecticRhetoric, slide 17-21] In this handbook texts from the old curriculum (Logica Vetus) are combined with new texts, translated into Latin only in the twefth century (Logica Nova): Aristotle’s <em>Analytica priora</em> and <em>Analytica posteriora</em>, his <em>Topica</em> and <em>Sophisiti elenchi </em>[link to text portraits]. The combination of all of these texts in one codex is characteristic for the university milieu, as is the lay-out of the book: it has a relatively small area of main text in the middle, and is surrounded by ample white space to accomodate glosses and commentaries [see also ±a±3gc±a±). Multiple columns have been prepared to make sure that a single passage in the main text could get multiple excursory notes, without giving up a clear visual placement lining it up to the right place on the page.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_4_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In addition to the regular writing lines, a grid is made with extra vertical and horizontal lines (here marked in light blue) dividing the page into four vertical columns and four horizontal sections. The sections accomodate the comments in the margin in such a way that they line up with the main text, even when there are multiple comments to one passage. Digressions or excursus are generally placed in the upper and lower margins.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_4_vc }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In the bottom margin of f. 8v and on 9r, we find more examples of such ‘horizontal’ diagrams. ±a±3ds±a±. It shows the thought experiments Aristotle’s text provokes, going from one part of a sentence to the next and thinking through how they are connected. Yet they are visualized with different shapes.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_8_v_9_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In the margin, different hands are clearly distinguishable by their individual scripts (1 in red, 2 in green, 3 in blue). Hand 3 uses a maniculum or pointing hand to mark a point of interest. The presence of different hands also implies that the text was read by several successive students.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_6_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Texts from the <em>logica nova</em>, such as the opening of Aristotle’s <em>Analytica priora </em>and <em>posteriora </em>on f. 164v and 218r), are laid out in the same manner as texts from the <em>logica vetus</em>: with the grid of blocks provided for commentary, multiple layers, and large decorated initials.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_164_v_218_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On some pages, such as here on f. 44v, the notes are given extra charm with heads drawn in red or brown ink, some also with some extra colour. Perhaps this made it easier for the reader to remember or retrieve the specific passage.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_44_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>A teaching scene at the bottom of f. 17 r, showing a teacher on the left and a student on the floor in front of him, reminds us of the context in which this manuscript functioned: the medieval university.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_17_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Several drawings and painted illuminations in this book illustrate the school context of the book. On f. 172r we find a line drawing of a master teaching five students. Just as in the previous image, he does not have a book to teach from [link TeachersStudents, ‘Books for the classroom], but is clearly expaining something and using gestures to get his message across. Note that both in the previous image and in this one, the teacher is a monk, with a monk’s cloak and shaved head, and so are the students. On f. 250v, finally, we find two students debating: perhaps they are engaged in an exercise preparing them for the <em>disputatio</em>. Their gestures suggest that they are arguing, and so does the text below which they are placed: it is Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em>, which offers the fundamentals for the art of arguing.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_172_r_250_v }}<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> N.J.
