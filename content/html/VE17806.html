<p>±col1span±</p><h2>A Handbook of Logic from the Faculty of Arts</h2><p>At the Faculty of Arts, students acquired a basic education in the art of logic, in reading at an advanced level and arguing about texts, in solving contradictions and speaking in public. <sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> From the Faculty of Arts they could progress to the Faculties of Theology, Law or Medicine. In this handbook texts from the old curriculum (Logica Vetus<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup>) are combined with new texts, translated into Latin only in the 12th century (Logica Nova): Aristotle’s Analytica priora and Analytica posteriora, his Topica and Sophisiti elenchi. The combination of all of these texts in one codex is characteristic for the university milieu, as is the lay-out of the book: it has a relatively small area of main text in the middle, and is surrounded by ample white space to accommodate glosses and commentaries. Multiple columns have been prepared to make sure that a single passage in the main text could get multiple excursory notes, without giving up a clear visual placement lining it up to the right place on the page.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Opening of Aristotle’s Peri hermeneias (De interpretatione, On interpretation) on f. 4v.
