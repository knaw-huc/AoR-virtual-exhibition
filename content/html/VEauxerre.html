<p>±col1±</p><p>The monastery of St. Germain at Auxerre was founded in the 5th century, and had an important and influential school in the Carolingian period. Some of its masters were Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre, both known for their copious production of commentaries or gloss-collections.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ±a±3gc±a±</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Heiric was a member of the monastic community at Auxerre from a child’s age on: it was common practice, in the early middle ages, to donate children to monasteries as <em>oblates</em>, new prospective members of the community. Heiric himself showed intellectual promise, and was taught by a famous master: Lupus of Ferrières (c. 805-c. 862), a scholar at the court of the Carolingian emperor Charles the Bald. </p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[germain.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Chain of teachers</h2><p>The relation between teachers and students was important in the Middle Ages: teachers kept in touch with their students and the other way around, and used these relations to define their identity. Alcuin, for example, sent letters to his students, gave them affectionate nicknames [link women &amp;debate] and admonished them to be good scholars, Christians and friends. Thus these teachers and students formed intellectual networks, which created a sense of shared intellectual identity in the Carolingian empire.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>±col2±</p><p>A famous chain of teachers is: Alcuin, who taught, among others, Hrabanus Maurus, who taught, among others, Lupus of Ferrières, who taught, among others, Heiric of Auxerre, who taught , among others, Remigius of Auxerre. Heiric of Auxerre was also taught by Haymo of Auxerre, who was taught by Murethach. Remigius of Auxerre was the teacher of Odo of Cluny and others.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[hrabanus.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Teachers in manuscripts</h2><p>Teachers are present in manuscripts by means of their glosses and commentaries±a±3gc±a±: their explanations were written down in the margins of the texts they taught. Generally speaking, these are anonymous: the explanations, associations, synonyms or other thoughts about the texts are without title, which could identify them as the work of a certain author. In rare cases, however, we do find the names of some masters. A particular rich case is Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949 ±a±m12±a±, in which we find several names, and among them are the names of Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_cover_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949 is a manuscript with a set of texts on logic.
