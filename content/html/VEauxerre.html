Some of its masters were Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre, both known for their copious production of commentaries or gloss-collections.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ±a±3gc±a±</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Heiric of Auxerre (841-876)</h2><p>Heiric was a member of the monastic community at Auxerre from a child’s age on.

Traces in medieval manuscripts show the practices of education in multiple ways. One of them is the glosses and notes we find in the margin of many manuscripts. They reflect the way in which a text was used by the teacher in the classroom.</p><p>Generally speaking, these glosses and notes are anonymous: they are nameless voices who add their explanations, associations, and synonyms or other thoughts to the text.
