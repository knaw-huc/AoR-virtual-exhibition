It had an important and influential school in the Carolingian period. Two of its masters were Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre, both known for their copious production of <a href="http://theme3#theme3">commentaries or gloss-collections</a>. Heiric (841-876) was a member of the monastic community at Auxerre from a child’s age on: it was common practice, in the early middle ages, to donate children to monasteries as <em>oblates</em>, new prospective members of the community. Heiric himself showed intellectual promise, and was taught by a famous master: Lupus of Ferrières (c. 805-c. 862), a scholar at the court of the Carolingian emperor Charles the Bald.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[germain.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2>Teachers in manuscripts</h2><p>Teachers are present in manuscripts by means of their glosses and commentaries: their explanations were written down in the margins of the texts they taught. Generally speaking, these marginal texts are anonymous: they are explanations, associations, synonyms or other thoughts about the texts in the centre of the page. They are often without title, which could identify them as the work of a certain author. In rare cases, however, we do find the names of some masters. A particular rich case is manuscript <a href="http://lat12949#lat12949">Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949</a>, in which we find several names, and among them are the names of Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[12949side.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949 is a manuscript with a set of texts on logic.
