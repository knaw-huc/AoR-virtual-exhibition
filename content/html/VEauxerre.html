<p>±col1±</p><h2>Auxerre in the Carolingian period<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </h2><p>The monastery of St. Germain at Auxerre was founded in the fifth century. It had an important and influential school in the Carolingian period. Some of its masters were Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre, both known for their copious production of commentaries or gloss-collections (see also ±a±3gc±a±). Heiric (841-876) was a member of the monastic community at Auxerre from a child’s age on: it was common practice, in the early middle ages, to donate children to monasteries as <em>oblates</em>, new prospective members of the community. Heiric himself showed intellectual promise, and was taught by a famous master: Lupus of Ferrières (c. 805-c. 862), a scholar at the court of the Carolingian emperor Charles the Bald.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p> [[[germain.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Chain of teachers</h2><p>The relation between teachers and students was important in the Middle Ages: teachers kept in touch with their students and the other way around, and used these relations to define their identity. Alcuin, for example, sent letters to his students, gave them affectionate nicknames [link women &amp;debate] and admonished them to be good scholars, Christians and friends. Thus these teachers and students formed intellectual networks, which created a sense of shared intellectual identity in the Carolingian empire.</p><p>A famous chain of teachers is: Alcuin taught Hrabanus Maurus, who taught Lupus of Ferrières, who taught Heiric of Auxerre, who taught Remigius of Auxerre. </p><p>Heiric of Auxerre was also taught by Haymo of Auxerre, who was taught by Murethach. Remigius of Auxerre was the teacher of Odo of Cluny and others. Teachers and students form tight-knit networks of relationships and knowledge exchange.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>We can see such an affectionate relationship depicted here, in manuscript Vienna, ÖnB, cod. 652, on fol. 24: Hrabanus (left) and Alcuin (middle) dedicate a work to Archbishop Otgar of Mainz (Right). As the teacher (with more seniority), Alcuin has his arm around Hrabanus’ shoulder, expressing his support when introducing him to the Archbishop. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[hrabanus.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2>Teachers in manuscripts</h2><p>Teachers are present in manuscripts by means of their glosses and commentaries ±a±3gc±a±: their explanations were written down in the margins of the texts they taught. Generally speaking, these are anonymous: the explanations, associations, synonyms or other thoughts about the texts are without title, which could identify them as the work of a certain author. In rare cases, however, we do find the names of some masters. A particular rich case is manuscript Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949 ±a±m12±a±, in which we find several names, and among them are the names of Heiric and Remigius of Auxerre.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[12949side.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949 is a manuscript with a set of texts on logic. On this opening page, fol. 1r, the Latin translation of Aristotle’s <em>On Interpretation</em> [link text portrait] starts: INCIPIUNT PERIERMENIAE ARISTOTELIS. In the margins and in between the lines, many notes have been added, even across the page.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_1_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here, on fol. 24r, we see a text which is even more heavily glossed: the whole space around the text is filled with comments.

It is a matter of debate whether he actually authored all these commentaries, compiled them from existing commentary traditions, or had them compiled by students and scholars in his school.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>In manuscript Paris, BnF, lat. 7900A±a±m79±a±, we see his commentary on the book on Dialectic in Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis</em> [text portrait].
