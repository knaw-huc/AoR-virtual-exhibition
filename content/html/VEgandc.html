<p>±col1±</p><p>Already in Late Antiquity, to sit in a class meant to read a text<em> </em>(<em>lectio</em>) under the guidance of a teacher. The notes of the teacher sometimes survive in the form of glosses (scattered notes) or a full commentary, treating different aspects of the text. Pictures of teachers in manuscripts generally look like this portrait on the right: a teacher is sitting behind a lectern and reading from a (large) book, and a group of students is sitting on the floor or on benches in front of him, having a (smaller) book in front of them or wax tablets to take notes. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[university.jpg]]]</p>±meta±<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On the page, these notes and commentaries were organised around the text in particular fashions: the lay-out varies in relation to the nature and the extent of the commentary, and of course, also according to the size of the page and the margin.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-commentaries }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Organized lay-out</h2><p>The page can be very well organized: neat spaces in the margin and in between the lines offer space to enter notes and glosses that are copied from one manuscript to the next. Marks (called ‘signes de renvoi’ or ‘tie-marks’) link the note in the margin to the specific place in the main text to which it belongs.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_30_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p><strong>Messy lay-out</strong></p><p>Pages can also be completely overgrown with glosses and notes. Notes can end up on the wrong page, or be added on separate inserted slips of parchment. A page can be so densely glossed that it is difficult to see where one note ends, and the other begins, or to which phrase they belong</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_24_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Heavily of lightly glossed</h2><p>On the page, a wealth of notes can be added, but also just a few. This can even vary per page: in the same manuscript, one page is completely filled, while the other is empty. Typically, the first (few) pages are heavily annotated, but this activity then dies out quickly.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf278_49_r_50_v_52_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Some texts were so fundamental to the curriculum, that their commentaries became settled texts in themselves, and in their turn entered the curriculum. The page was designed to incorporate both text ánd commentary, for example by providing for a grid to accomodate the commentary, or separate writing lines  in the margin. Sometimes the text in the margin also took on the appearance of a separate, continuously written text, just executed in a smaller font. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_113_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>What do the notes do?</h2><p>In modern information theory, good information management ought to strive for four goals, the four s’s of information management: store, sort, select and summarize information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> In medieval manuscripts, these four s’s are also happening in the margins. The notes are there, generally speaking, to help the reader, and storing, sorting, selecting and summarizing are important strategies. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[scholar.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In manuscripts, marginal notes are used to: (1) call attention to certain things, (2) summarize and highlight the structure of the text, (3) explain and expand, (4) refer to different authorities and compare (5), visualize material in lists, diagrams and schemes, (6) give the reader some guidance in how to interpret certain things.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-marginalnotes }}<p><br /></p><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> (Ann M.
