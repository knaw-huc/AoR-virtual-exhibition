<p>±col1±</p><h2>Reading in class<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></h2><p>Already in Late Antiquity, to sit in a class meant to read a text<em> </em>(<em>lectio</em>) under the guidance of a teacher. The notes of the teacher sometimes survive in the form of glosses (scattered notes) or a full commentary, treating different aspects of the text. Pictures of teachers in manuscripts generally look like this portrait on the right: a teacher is sitting behind a lectern and reading from a (large) book, and a group of students is sitting on the floor or on benches in front of him, having in front of them a (smaller) book or wax tablets to take notes. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[university.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On the page, these notes and commentaries were organised around the text in particular fashions: the lay-out varies in relation to the nature and the extent of the commentary, and of course, also according to the size of the page and the margin.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[grootnaarklein.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Lay-out: Organized ...</h2><p>The page can be very well organized: neat spaces in the margin and in between the lines offer space to enter notes and glosses that are copied from one manuscript to the next. Marks (called ‘signes de renvoi’ or ‘tie-marks’) link the note in the margin to the specific place in the main text to which it belongs.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_30_v2 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>... versus messy</h2><p>Pages can also be completely overgrown with glosses and notes. Notes can end up on the wrong page, or be added on separate inserted slips of parchment. A page can be so densely glossed that it is difficult to see where one note ends, and the other begins, or to which phrase they belong.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_24_v2 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2>Heavily of lightly glossed</h2><p>On the page, a wealth of notes can be added, but also just a few. This can even vary per page: in the same manuscript, one page is completely filled, while the other is empty. Typically, the first (few) pages are heavily annotated, but this activity then dies out quickly. An example is found in this manuscript: Paris, BnF, Lat. 2788, which contains a copy of Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em> (in Boethius’ translation). The manuscript was made in Fleury around the year 1000. At the opening of the text, on fol. 49r, long notes are added, but there are less, already, on fol. 50v and the margins of fol. 52r are virtually empty. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>[[[2788f49r.jpg]]]</p><p>±col2±	</p><p>[[[2788f50v.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[2788f52r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Some texts were so fundamental to the curriculum, that their commentaries became settled texts in themselves, and in their turn entered the curriculum. The page was designed to incorporate both text <em>and</em> commentary, for example by providing for a grid to accommodate the commentary, or separate writing lines in the margin. Sometimes the text in the margin also took on the appearance of a separate, continuously written text, just executed in a smaller font. Here in manuscript Paris, BnF, Lat. 7900A, f. 113r (a copy of Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis</em> with the commentary of Remigius of Auxerre [links to ms portrait and Auxerre in Teachers&amp;Students]), we can see how the balance between text and commentary can be extreme: the main text of Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis</em> is found in the narrow column on the left, while Remigius of Auxerre’s commentary occupies the broad column on the right, where it is written as a continuous text.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_113_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>What do the notes do?</h2><p>In modern information theory, good information management strives for four goals, i.e. the four s’s of information management: <em>store</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>select</em> and <em>summarize</em> information. In medieval manuscripts, these four s’s are also happening in the margins. The notes are there, generally speaking, to help the reader, and storing, sorting, selecting and summarizing are important strategies. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[scholar.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>In manuscripts, we can distinguish multiple functions of marginal notes and various techniques to read in and learn from books. The list of functions and techniques is large, but we can illustrate here six general examples: (1) the glosses and notes call attention to certain things, (2) summarize and highlight the structure of the text, (3) explain and expand, (4) refer to different authorities and compare (5), visualize material in lists, diagrams and schemes, (6) give the reader some guidance in how to interpret certain things.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2>1. Attention please!</h2><p>For calling attention to certain things in the tekst, multiple kinds of signs were used: nota signs, asterisks, pointing fingers (<em>maniculae</em>), pointing faces, etcetera. In our manuscript portraits we find many examples, for example in Leiden, UB, BPL 25; Leiden, UB, <a href="file:///\\ia\Huygens$\home\ReneeS\Downloads\bpl144#bpl144">BPL 144</a>; Paris, BnF, 11127; and Paris, BnF, Lat. 17806.

Summarize and structure</h2><p>It is clear that readers were keen on summarizing the text and structuring it, so that they could store key parts in their memory and so that they could re-find things in books they were consulting. Keywords, notes relating to the structure of the text or were all used to achieve these things. Examples are found in Paris, BnF, Lat. 11127 and Leiden, UB, BPL 25 [link ms portraits]. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In Paris, BnF, Lat. 11127, f. 49r, for example, we see how a marginal index of topics was created in capital letters in the margin, and how the start of a new book was announced when it was not clear from the text itself (the green blocks are ours).</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[11127f49r2.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In Leiden, UB, BPL 25, f. 6v, several techniques are used to clarify the dialogue structure of the text (the blocks are ours).</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[25f6v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2>3. Explain and expand</h2><p>The main function of commentary and notes seems to be to explain the content of the main text, so that it would make sense to the student or reader. A technique that was often used to explain was to expand: to include new information that was perhaps already known from other contexts, and make the connection. Examples abound in the manuscript portraits presented here, e.g. in Leiden, UB, BPL 88; Einsiedeln, SB, Cod. 29 (878) or in the Paris manuscripts BnF, Lat. 7900A and Lat. 12949, where slips are added into the binding to attach more relevant material.

Comparison</h2><p>The technique of <em>expanding </em>texts by connecting them to other works, also involved <em>comparison</em>. In one book, it was pointed out, the technical term for something could be <em>x</em>, while in another it could be <em>y </em>or <em>z</em>. In one book, a certain concept could be divided up into x sub-divisions, in another it could a different number. Examples are found in Leiden, UB, VLF 48 and Leiden, UB, BPL 88. In Leiden, UB, VLF 48, f. 92v, for example, diagrams are added that visualize how the planets travel through the cosmos on their orbits according to three different authorities: Martianus, Platonists and Pythagoreans.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>[[[48f92v.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>[[[88f4v.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2>5. Visualize in diagrams and schemes</h2><p>The technique of visualizing material in order to make it memorable, to clarify the structure and to make a summary of all the text’s components is very common in almost all of the manuscripts we portray here. These are explored more fully here [O’Daly Diagrams I-II-III], but examples abound in: Leiden, UB, VLF 48; Leiden, UB, BPL 25; Leiden, UB, BPL 84; Leiden, UB, GRO 22; Leiden, UB, VLQ 103; Paris, BnF, Lat. 17806 and Paris, BnF, Lat. 12949.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>[[[84f89v2.jpg]]]</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[22f11rfr.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><h2>6. Guide the reader</h2><p>A final function of marginal notes listed here are instances where the annotator wishes to warn the reader that something should be read with care, or with suspicion. The annotator sometimes exercised a kind of compelling guidance from the margin, to make sure that the reader would not misunderstand. An example is found in Brussels, KB, Ms. 5169, fol. 42r [link controversial-art]: here we see a snake drawn in the margin to warn the reader of heretical material in the text.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[prosper.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>Sources used for this contribution:</p><ul><li>Mariken Teeuwen and Irene van Renswoude (eds.), <em>The Annotated Book in the Early Middle Ages.
