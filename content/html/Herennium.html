<h2><em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></h2>

<p><em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>is a treatise about rhetoric addressed to Herennius. For a long time the work was attributed to Cicero. The reason for this attribution, which is now considered false, is that already in Late Antiquity the work was
  often copied together with Cicero’s rhetorical treatise <em>De inventione</em>. Due to its attribution to the famous ancient author, the treatise acquired a lasting name, fame and authority until well into the Renaissance. The two treatises were
  commonly used to teach rhetoric, the art of speaking well and effectively. </p>

<p><em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>is composed in four books, that aim to prepare the speaker <em>(orator)</em> for speaking at the forum and especially the law courts. In medieval schools and universities it was repurposed to teach how to argue in
  debates. The book has a famous description of a mnemonic technique: the memory can be trained by using visualizations of objects or events as points on an imagined journey along a route – the method of <em>loci</em> (places) or ‘memory palaces’.
  Because of its clarity and accessible style the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em> became an essential textbook in the Middle Ages. The text was extensively translated into vernacular languages from the thirteenth century onward, and continued to be
  used as a standard schoolbook on rhetoric during the Renaissance.</p>
