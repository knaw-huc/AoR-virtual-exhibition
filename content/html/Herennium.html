<p>±col1span±</p><h2><em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em></h2><table><tr><td></td></tr></table><p>The <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>is a treatise about rhetoric addressed to Herennius. For a long time the work was attributed to Cicero. The reason for this attribution, which is now considered false, is that already in Late Antiquity the work was often copied together with Cicero’s rhetorical treatise <em>De inventione</em>. Due to its attribution to the famous ancient author, the treatise acquired a lasting name, fame and authority until well into the Renaissance. The two treatises were commonly used to teach rhetoric, the art of speaking well and effectively. The <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>is a manual, composed in four books, that aims to prepare the speaker <em>(orator)</em> for speaking at the forum and especially the law courts. In medieval schools and universities these manuals were repurposed, in particular to teach how to argue in debates. The book has a famous description of a mnemonic technique: the memory can be trained by using visualizations of objects or events as points on an imagined journey along a route – the method of <em>loci</em> (places) or ‘memory palaces’. Because of its clarity and accessible style the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em> became an essential textbook in the Middle Ages. The text was extensively translated into vernacular languages from the thirteenth century onward, and continued to be used as a standard schoolbook on rhetoric during the Renaissance.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[memory.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>Katia Riccardo</p><p>±col3±</p><p>Paris, BnF, Lat. 15140, f. 65v (detail)</p>
