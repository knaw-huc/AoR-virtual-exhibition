<p>±col1±</p><p><strong>This part of the exhibition</strong> explores the relation between text and reality. How was the art of reasoning applied in actual debates? Did disputants make use of the rhetorical and dialectical  tropes and strategies that they encountered in the treatises of Cicero, Aristotle, Ps- Augustine or Boethius? Or were theory and practice far apart? </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[disputing2.jpg]]]</p><h2>The disputation on Adoptionism in 799</h2><p>Issue of debate: Did God adopt Christ as his son, or was Christ born with a divine nature? Secondary issue: what does ‘adoptivus’ precisely mean? Main protagonists: Archbishop Felix of Urgel (proponent of Spanish adoptionism) and Deacon Alcuin of York, scholar and teacher at Charlemagne’s court (opponent) Location: Charlemagne’s court at Aachen</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[aachenpalace.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>What went before?</h2><p>From the 780’s onwards Frankish and Spanish disputants were discussing a Spanish interpretation of the Trinity, which the Franks understood to be a revival of the early Christian heresy of Adoptionism and in particular the heresy of Nestorius, condemned at the council of Ephese in 431. In the 790’s the Carolingian ruler Charlemagne attempted to solve the matter by putting the issue on the agenda of two regional councils: 792 (Regensburg) and 794 (Frankfurt).</p><p>±col2± </p><p>Both councils condemned the position of the Spanish bishops. Felix, bishop of Urgel in Catalonia, recanted, but continued to teach the rejected doctrine back in Spain. In 798, Pope Leo III convenes a council in Rome and condemns Felix’s doctrine. Again, Felix disavows his beliefs but does not change his position once back in Urgel.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[psalter.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>799: Felix is summoned to Aachen to defend his views, and is brought before king Charlemagne. In a letter to his canons back home, Felix writes: “After I was led in the presence of our lord, the glorious and pious king Charles, and was presented before his countenance, I received his <em>licentia</em> according to the promise that the venerable bishop Leidrad made to us in Urgel.”</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[throne.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p><em>Licentia</em>, the right to speak out,  is a term we find in the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em>: <strong>“</strong>It is licentia when talking before those to whom we owe reverence or fear, we yet exercise our right to speak out”</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[licentia.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>To settle the issue once and for all, Charlemagne calls a public disputation between Felix and Alcuin.

This council and the heresy of Nestorius was particularly relevant to those involved in the debate on Spanish Adoptionism, since Nestorius taught that Christ was ‘adopted’. The disputants in the debate on adoptionism took their inspiration from the councils of the early church and the discussions on the nature of Christ that were held at the time.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>In the texts of the early medieval controversy on adoptionism, we encounter many references to the heretics of the fourth and centuries and the emperors and councils that condemned them. The proceedings of the disputation in Aachen in 799 were modelled on the first ecumenical councils. With this important difference: no books were burned this time.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[council3.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>The manuscript Alcuin consulted to prepare for the debate with Felix</h2><p>Alcuin consulted the acts of the council of Ephese to find arguments against the teaching of Nestorius on adoptionism, condemned at this council, to use against Felix. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[ephese.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The disputation is described in the <em>Life of Alcuin </em>as battle between Charlemagne’s champion Alcuin (who is emphatically presented as Charlemagne’s teacher) and Felix as champion of the opposing party<em>. </em>According to the author of the <em>Life, </em>the disputation lasted several days, in front of an audience of bishops, who listened in silence, and king Charlemagne. Their altercation is depicted as a physical clash, with Felix, severely wounded, fleeing from the blows of Alcuin’s weapons. The description is reminiscent of depictions of armed combat between virtues and vices in Prudentius’ <em>Battle for the Soul of Man. </em>It was common usage to employ military imagery to describe the public performance of a disputation.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[prudentius.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>What were these weapons that Alcuin used to force Felix into submission? Apparently, his weapons were patristic quotations. Felix writes that he was won over when Alcuin quoted from a letter of the martyr Cyril of Alexandria – an authoritative source previously unknown to him. Cyril was the main opponent of the heretic Nestorius, who, as we have seen, also held that Christ was ‘adopted’</p><p>±col2±</p><p>When Felix read this quotation (it seems manuscript proof was brought to him) he burst out in tears and recanted his errors.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[cyril.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>After Felix admits defeat, he writes down a <em>confessio </em>in which he disavows his adoptionist teachings and professes his orthodox faith. He promises never to use the contested term ‘adoptivus’ ever again. Interestingly, the creed that he uses is the <em>confessio</em> of Nestorius, who was condemned as a heretic at the Council of Ephese in 431.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>The <em>Confessio</em> was sent to his canons in Urgel, and via them to those in his network who still adhered to adoptionist views</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[reims2.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In the Reims manuscript, the abbreviation NESTOR four times in the margin, next to Felix’s profession of faith. Why did Felix choose the creed of Nestorius, of all creeds? Was it his own choice, or did his opponents make him, to frame him as a Nestorian?</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[reims3.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><p>Alcuin asks Charlemagne for permission to publish the dossier of texts that he brought to the disputation with Felix. Charlemagne is crowned emperor shortly after the disputation in Aachen, over which he had presided like the Christian Roman emperors Constantine and Theodosus Felix is sent to Lyon and put into the custody of Archbishop Leidrad. He enjoys relative freedom in Lyon, but is not allowed to return to his see in Urgel.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Years later, Alcuin and Felix meet again, when Leidrad and Felix visit Alcuin in Tours. Alcuin writes that there is now ‘much love between them’ Emotions play an important role in the narrative representation of  this disputation. Emotions assist in recognizing the truth, next to rational arguments and scriptural quotations. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[felix.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>A posthumous debate: bishop Agobard against Felix, after Felix’s death</h2><p>Felix was held in custody in Lyon until his death. When his custodian, bishop Leidrad died, his successor Agobard ‘inherited’ the heretic. After Felix’s death, Agobard found a pamphlet in his room in which Felix defended his old teaching. Agobard was shocked. So the old heretic had not converted to the true faith after all! He wrote a treatise ‘Against Felix’ in which he combatted Felix’s views and integrated (or paraphrased) sections of Felix’s pamphlet. A tenth-century reader expresses his disapproval of Felix’s teaching: HEU MALE PESSIME</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[afbeelding ontbreekt]</p>
