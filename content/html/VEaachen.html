<p>±col1±</p><p>In 799 a public disputation was held in the palace of Aachen between Deacon Alcuin of York and Bishop Felix of Urgell to settle the hotly contested issue of adoptionism. The disputation was the finale of a debate that started in the late eighth century.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>In the last decade of the eighth century Hispanic and Frankish scholars debated the person and nature of Christ. In the view of their Frankish opponents, bishops Elipand of Toledo (d. 808) and Felix of Urgell (d. 818) taught that Christ was the adopted son of God. The debate is commemorated in the tenth-century <em>Chronicle of Moissac, </em>written in the Catalonian monastery of Rippol. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[rippol.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The Franks gave this teaching the name of a second-century sect, whose adherents believed that God adopted the man Jesus as his son at the moment of his baptism. The label ‘adoptionism’ was used to stigmatize Arian theology in the fourth century, the teaching of Nestorius of Alexandria in the fifth century, the views of Abelard and Gilbert de la Porrée in the twelfth century, and, evidently, the teachings of Hispanic bishops in the eighth century.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[baptism.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Councils</h2><p>Bishops Elipand and Felix did not precisely teach that Christ was the adopted son of God, but held that Christ “emptied himself, took upon him (<em>sumpsit</em>) the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men” (Philippians 2: 7, Vetus Latina). When Elipand and Felix used the term <em>adoptio, </em>they used it as a synonym of <em>(as)sumptio, </em>from the verb (<em>as)sumere ‘</em>to take upon’ or ‘to accept’, in accordance with Philippians 2: 7. Their theology and terminology went back to Hispanic tradition; it had grown from Hispanic conciliar literature of the sixth and seventh centuries and specifically from the acts of the councils of Toledo [Cavadini, 1995, 7]. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>The codex on the right contains the acts of the Visigothic councils of Toledo and a protocol for the proceedings of councils (<em>ordo de celebrando concilio</em>).

It reminded them of the heresy of Nestorius, another teacher who was labelled an adoptionist, whose doctrine was condemned at the council of Ephesus in 431. Nestorius had argued that Christ had two natures (<em>ousiae</em>), human and divine, which corresponded with two <em>personae</em> (masks).</p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[tang.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[reconstruction.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here we see an illustration of the Council of Ephesus (431) in a late eighth- or early ninth-century canon law collection. Emperor Theodosius II is depicted as presiding over the assembly of bishops who condemned the teaching of Nestorius. This council and the heresy of Nestorius were particularly relevant to those involved in the debate on Hispanic Adoptionism, since it was believeved that he Hispanic bishops were reviving Nestorius’ heresy. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[council.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Hispanic adoptionism was initially mainly taught within the Hispanic realm in the regions under Ummayad rule. At first the discussion was of little interest to the Franks, but when Charlemagne conquered the Spanish March (Catalonia) in 789, the teaching of Bishop Felix of Urgell, now situated within Charlemagne’s realm, came to be seen as a threat to Carolingian uniformity of faith. In 792 Charlemagne convoked the council of Regensburg and summoned Felix to appear before the council, where he was examined by Paulinus, archbishop of Aquileia. When the council condemned his teaching, Felix recanted, wrote a profession of faith and went to Rome to do penance. Back in Urgell, however, he continued to teach the rejected doctrine. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Charlemagne convened another council, this time in Frankfurt, in 794, to review the matter once again. The image on the right is believed to represent the council of Frankfurt of 794, where the Hispanic doctrine of Adoptionism was condemned for the second time. It has been suggested that the man in the middle is Bishop Felix of Urgell, or perhaps his colleague Elipand of Toledo [Sieben, 1990] The oval shape of the assembly is reminiscent of a fighting arena in a Roman amphitheatre.</p><p>±col3±</p>{{> folios/folio-psalter }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Interestingly, the pen drawing does not illustrate a psalm, as the other illustrations in this Psalter do, but a creed, that is a statement of belief. Below the illustration it reads: <em>Incipit fides catholicam; Here begins the Catholic faith. </em>The creed is known as the Athanasian Creed or as the <em>Quicunque vult </em>after its opening words. It was composed in Gaul in the fifth or sixth century and recited daily at the office of Prime. The creed focusses on Trinitarian doctrine and on the person and  nature of Christ. The text of this creed was therefore highly relevant to the debate on adoptionism. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>From the pseudo-Athanasian creed: “The catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons (<em>personas</em>), nor dividing the Essence <em>(substantia</em>). For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one” The wording of the peudo-Athanasian creed, and in particular the discussion of the Christological categories <em>substantia, natura </em>and <em>persona</em>, is grafted onto the language and dialectical structure of Aristotelian logic</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[psalter5.jpg]]]    </p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Disputation between Alcuin and Felix</h2><p>After the council of Frankfurt in 794, when Felix’s teaching was again condemned, the same pattern repeated itself: Felix disavowed his adoptionis beliefs, repented, but continued teaching adoptionism once he was back in Urgell. More drastic measures were needed, so it was felt. In 799, Charlemagne summoned Felix to the palace in Aachen to engage in a public debate with the court scholar Alcuin of York, to settle the matter once and for all. If you want to know more about Alcuin, go to Charlemagne sent Archbishop Leidrad of Lyon to Urgell to negotiate on his behalf. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Felix heeded the king’s summons and travelled to Aachen. He was brought before King Charlemagne. In a letter he sent to his supporters back home, Felix gave an account of the event: “After I was led in the presence of our lord, the glorious and pious king Charles, and was presented before his countenance, I received his <em>licentia</em> according to the promise that the venerable bishop Leidrad made to us in Urgell”  (PL 96, 883)</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[throne2.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p><em>Licentia, </em>the right to speak out before authorities, is a term we find in the Rhetoric for Herennius, an anonymous rhetorical treatise that was ascribed to Cicero in the middle ages.</p><p>±col2±</p><p><strong>Licentia</strong>: <strong>“</strong>It is <em>licentia</em> when <strong>t</strong>alking before those to whom we owe reverence or fear, we yet exercise our right to speak out” Rhetorica ad Herennium IV, 36, Trans.

The ground rules of the disputation in were probably modelled on what people knew at the time of the proceedings of the first ecumenical councils [Raaijmakers/van Renswoude 2016] and cycles of illustrations of those councils [Reynolds, 1987, 214] that portrayed emperors presiding over conciliar discussions, seated in the midst of bishops. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-council }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Also in other respects the councils of the early church and their Christological discussions provided sources of inspiration. Alcuin for example, in preparation of the disputation with Felix, consulted the Acts of the Council of Ephesus (the council that had condemned Nestorius) to find arguments against the teaching of Nestorius so he could use them against Felix. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>This manuscript contains the Latin translation of the Acts of the Council of Ephesus that Alcuin consulted. The Acts contain among other things an address of Bishop Cyril of Alexandria against Nestorius. According to  Bernhard Bischoff , Alcuin or his assistant wrote s’s and d’s in the margin to indicate which passages should be copied. The s stands for <em>scribe</em> (copy)  and the d for <em>dimitte </em>(stop). [Bischoff, 1962] The passages were collected in a florilegium that Alcuin composed in Tours and that became his <em>Book Against the Heresy of Felix ( Liber contra Felicem heresim), </em>see below.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[tours.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The disputation between Alcuin and Felix is described in the <em>Life of Alcuin </em>as a battle between two champions representing the Frankish and Hispanic schools of thought. Alcuin is emphatically presented as Charlemagne’s teacher (<em>institutorem suum, magistrum suum) </em>fighting the battle against heresy for him.<em> </em>According to the anonymous author of the <em>Life of Alcuin, </em>the disputation lasted six days and took place before an audience of bishops, who ‘listened in silence’, and before King Charlemagne ‘seated in their midst’. The altercation between Felix and Alcuin is depicted as an armed clash. Felix received fatal hits and fled, severely wounded, from the blows of Alcuin’s weapons [PL 100, 98]. The description is reminiscent of depictions of armed combat between virtues and vices in Prudentius’ <em>Battle for the Soul of Man</em>. It was common usage to employ military imagery to describe the public performance of a disputation, see Dialectic, a controversial art? ±a±4ca±a±</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[prudentius2.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>What were these ‘weapons’ that Alcuin used to out-argue Felix?According to the author of the <em>Life of Alcuin</em>, his weapons were patristic quotations, that is, of the Church Fathers. Felix was won over when Alcuin quoted from a letter of Cyril of Alexandria, the main opponent of the heretic Nestorius. When Felix read this quotation (it seems manuscript proof was brought to him) he burst out in tears and recanted his errors [PL 100, 98]</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Felix subscribed to this version of the events in the profession of faith that he drew up after the disputation (see further on). In this document, Felix writes that Alcuin convinced him with ‘truthful argumentation, not with violence ‘(<em>non in violentis, sed ratione veritatis</em>, PL 96, 883).</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[cyril.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>It does not become clear from either Felix’s <em>Confessio </em>or the <em>Life of Alcuin, </em>the only two sources to recount the disputation, what type of ‘truthful argumentation’ Alcuin employed. The <em>Life of Alcuin </em>gives the impression that he just hurled patristic quotations at his opponent. There are, however, two other texts that are closely related to the disputation that may give us an impression of how their exchange may have proceeded and what kind of argumentation schemes may have been employed. The first text is Alcuin’s <em>Seven Books Against Felix, </em>the second a letter he wrote to a noble lady at Charlemagne’s court. Alcuin’s <em>Seven Books Against Felix</em>, completed shortly after the debate in Aachen, offers us a glimpse of the type of argumentation that may have been employed during the disputation. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Both participants appear to have made use of Aristotelian categorical logic. Yet whereas Alcuin focussed on predicates that <em>are in</em> a subject, Felix appears to have taken the semantic approach, concentrating on predicates that can be <em>said of</em> a subject. To Alcuin’s mind Felix’s logic is inconsistent: ‘True’ and ‘not true’ can in no way be one; thus ‘true son’ and ‘not true son’ may not both refer to one son; nor can ‘true God’ and ‘God nuncupative’ (i.e. God in name only) be one God [...] There is no way that both predicates can be in one <em>persona. </em>Alcuin, <em>Adversus Felicem, </em>trans. Cavadini, 1993, 90</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[tours2.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Alcuin continues to point out inconsistencies of Felix’s teaching, with appeal to logic and reason: For who is unaware that as regards a given father the <em>persona </em>of an adoptive son is one <em>persona </em>and that of a proper son is another? For no father, even according to human custom, can adopt his own proper son to himself, as though he were unrelated; nor could he make someone who he has adopted into a proper son, since the fact that someone else has begotten him had already precluded blood relation.

Cavadini, 1993, 92.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>The terms <em>persona</em> and <em>natura </em>were key concepts in the fifth-century debate on the teachings of Nestorius. Boethius, in his treatise against Nestorius, discussed <em>persona </em>and <em>natura </em>at length, but there is no indication that Alcuin read Boethius’ tract (Erismann, 2013, 157] In all likelihood, Alcuin borrowed his terminology from the Acts of the Council of Ephesus (see above).</p><p>±col3±</p><p>Go to <a href="https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.1339">https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.1339</a> for an eleventh-century pen and ink wash drawing of the council of Ephesus.

In this letter, he gave the lady instructions on how to conduct a disputation with a heretic, and offered to teach her the method of dialectical enquiry <em>(disciplina interrogationes dialecticae</em>).

This is one such example: “One should ask whether every man that exists of a body and soul is a proper son of his father. If he says: yes, a proper son, then one should ask whether the soul proceeds from the father just like the flesh. If he says: no, then one should draw the inference: how is a man the proper son of his father if his soul does not proceed from the father, like the flesh”  Alcuin, Ep. 204, ed. Dümmler p. 338.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>The argumentation scheme that Alcuin presents here is based on the rules of inference. An opponent (such as Felix?) is led through a series of questions to accept conditional statements, and then ushered to agree upon a conclusion that logically follows from the accepted statements. Boethius had explained the rules of inference on which all argument is based in his <em>On Topical Differences </em>and <em>On Hypothetical Syllogisms </em></p><p>±col3±</p><p>What Alcuin presents here is a clear example of a hypothetical syllogism, with an ‘if-clause’ followed by a ‘then-clause’.

He promised never to use the contested terms ‘adoptivus’  or ‘nuncupativus’ (nominally) ever again. In this profession of faith, Felix distanced himself from the teaching of Nestorius and anathemized his heresy. This profession of faith was sent to his canons in Urgel, and via them to those in his network who still adhered to adoptionist views.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[reims.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>After his defeat in Aachen, Felix was not allowed to return to Urgell, but was entrusted to the custody of Archbishop Leidrad. In Lyon, he enjoyed relative freedom of movement. When Leidrad died, his successor Agobard ‘inherited’ the heretic. After Felix’s death, Agobard found a pamphlet in his room in which Felix defended his old teaching. Agobard was shocked. So the old heretic had not converted to the true faith after all! He wrote a treatise ‘Against Felix’ in which he combatted Felix’s views and integrated (or paraphrased) sections of Felix’s pamphlet. A tenth-century reader expresses his disapproval of Felix’s teaching: HEU   MALE    PESSIME</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Yet in a way, Felix had kept his word. In none of the fragments of his pamphlet that Agobard incorporated in his treatise, the terms ‘adoptivus’ or ‘nuncupativus’ occur, which Felix had vowed never to use again. He had simply rephrased his teaching, without the forbidden words. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[heu.jpg]]]</p>
