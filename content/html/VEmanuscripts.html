<p>±col1span±</p><h2>Let the manuscripts speak for themselves</h2><p>Manuscripts are books written by hand (<em>manu-scriptum</em>), and the very fact that they are written by hand makes them fundamentally different from printed books. Each book is the result of a vast number of individual decisions, reflecting the time and circumstance of the maker and/or commisioner of the book: its style and format, its content, its execution, etcetera. In scholarly books (books produced for schools, private study or specifically for use at medieval universities) the imprint of the user of a book is often very recognisable: the page offer ample space for notes that can be added to the text, and these notes are rich sources of information of how texts were read, used and processed by their readers (see: theme 3 ±a±3gc±a±). In this virtual exhibition, we use the manuscripts as looking glasses to see the ways in which texts were used and worked with.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>We chose 13 manuscripts, spread across the medieval period and made in different parts of medieval Europe, to illustrate the techniques of medieval reading and studying. All of them have texts that were used in the study of <em>rhetoric</em> (the art of public speaking) and <em>dialectic </em>(the art of logical argumentation), because these two disciplines together were essential for <em>the art of reasoning</em>. The examples are random in the sense that we did not strive for a selection of the most important, oldest or prettiest examples: rather we chose them because they illustrate the story of how medieval readers made sense of their texts and how they used them to develop their own methods of reasoning. For each manuscript we selected a number of images that give you a sense of the manuscript as a whole. We present the information about the date, place where the manuscript was made as it is available in modern scholarship, followed by a journey through the manuscript’s interesting features and curious details. We see them as manuscript portraits: annotated sketches of the manuscripts’ contents, characters and historical contexts. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>The manuscripts are presented here in chronological order. A second way to start exploring the manuscripts is a map of medieval Europe, on which the places where the manuscripts were made are marked. A click on each point will transport you to a manuscript to explore. Each mansucript also features in one or more of the four themes that are presented in this exhibition: 1.dialectica and rhetorica; 2. teachers and students; 3. practices of studying and reading; and 4. debates and controversies. So each manuscript can be explored by itself, but you can also allow yourself to drift off from the main path and follow other stories in the exhibition.</p><p>±col3±</p>
