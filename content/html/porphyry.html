<h2>Porphyry’s <em>Isagoge</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup></h2><p>Porphyry was a philosopher from Tyre, Phoenicia (today Lebanon), active in the third century C.E. He wrote on all the relevant branches of knowledge of the time, including philosophy, religion, grammar, and natural science, but only a portion of his work survived. Porphyry was an important exponent of Neoplatonism, the dominant philosophical current of the period that reinterpreted the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his philosophical writings Porphyry attempted to conciliate Aristotle’s logical works with Platonic doctrine. Porphyry is best known for the <em>Isagoge</em>,<em> </em>an introduction to Aristotle's <a href="/text-portraits.html?portait=Aristotle1">logical works</a>. It was translated into Latin by <a href="/text-portraits.html?portait=Boethius2">Boethius</a>, and soon became an integral part of the <em>Organon</em> (“Instrument”; the set of logical works of Aristotle). It was one of the central texts for the study of logic in the medieval curriculum. </p><p>[[[ptree.jpg]]]</p><p>The <em>Isagoge</em> is an elucidation of Aristotle’s doctrine on the five universals or predicables: genus, species, difference, property, and accident. Each of these explain what a substance consists of. Taking a typical medieval monk as an example (generally a European male human), genus is “animal”, species is “man”, difference is “rational”, property is “able to speak”, and accident is “white”. Most iconic in his work is a diagrammatic representation of the relationship between the predicables known as the <a href="/trees#ptree"><em>Porphyrian tree</em></a>. The <em>Isagoge</em>, in the Latin translation by Boethius, became deeply influential in the Latin West and one of the basic introductory texts for the study of philosophy for at least a thousand years.<br /></p><p>Source used for this contribution: </p><p>Emilsson, Eyjólfur, "Porphyry", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Winter 2019 Edition), Edward N.
