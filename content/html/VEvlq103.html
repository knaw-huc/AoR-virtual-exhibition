<p>±col1±</p><h2>What’s inside?</h2><p>Leiden, UB, VLQ 103, is a rhetorical compilation containing two of the most popular classical works on rhetoric, namely Cicero’s <em>De inventione</em> (ff. 1-46r) and the Pseudo-Ciceronian <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>(ff. 52v-102r). The texts are sandwiched around a copy of the fourth book of Boethius’s <em>De differentiis topicis</em> (ff. 46r-52v).</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_cover_1_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Where did it come from?</h2><p>The script and decoration of this manuscript suggest that it was made in Italy in the second half of the twelfth century. Gold is used to highlight major initials throughout the volume, making this a rare example of a deluxe schoolbook.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_1_r_fr_102_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>But, this ownership description notes that the manuscript belonged to the theological faculty of the Sorbonne in Paris, and was gifted to it by Gerard d’Abbeville (d. 1272). Find out more about Gerard <em>here</em>. The ownership inscription is now largely illegible. This is because it was treated with reagent, a chemical mixture, that was used by scholars and librarians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century to reveal damaged and faded text. As we can see, the reagent has caused permanent damage to the parchment.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_102_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Aside from the evidence provided by the inscription, the cataloguer of the Vossius collection, K. A. De Meyïer, was also able to match the volume to a manuscript described in a catalogue of the library of Sorbonne made in 1338: <em>‘Libri Tullii et Boecii </em>(...) <em>Rhetorica Tullii. Incipit in 2<sup>o</sup> fol. ‘tum odii’, in pen. ‘in animatas’. Precium VII. sol.</em>’</p><p>±col2±</p><p>This description records that the volume contains writings of Cicero (‘Tullius’) and Boethius, specifically rhetorical works. The key clues which facilitate the matching of the entry to this manuscript is the indication of the first words found on f. 2r of the manuscript (‘<em>tum odii</em>) and on its penultimate folio (f. 101r, <em>‘in animatas</em>’). Given that manuscripts were copied by hand, it was highly unlikely that any other copy of the rhetorical works within the library’s collection would have these words at precisely these points – this was the book’s unique identifier. The final detail recorded by the catalogue entry is an estimate of the book’s cost, seven solidi.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_2_r }}<p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Glossing with schemata: <em>De inventione</em></h2><p>Although the manuscript dates from the twelfth century, its annotations are in a thirteenth-century hand. The annotations take the form of stemmatic diagrams, placed in the margin alongside the text. Nine schemata were added to the text of <em>De inventione. </em>They cluster towards the beginning of the text (ff. 3r-7r).These two schemes, added in the outer margin of <strong>f. 6v</strong>, summarise text from <em>De inventione,</em> I.XIV.19-20.15, where Cicero describes the parts of an oration (exordium, narrative, partition, confirmation, refutation, conclusion) and the types of cases (honourable, difficult, mean, ambiguous, obscure). The schemes were placed adjacent to the text (highlighted, reinforcing the enumeration already supplied in the text and directing the reader’s eye to the relevant passages. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_6_v_6_v_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Judicial rhetoric and the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em></h2><p>By contrast, twenty-eight diagrams were added to the text of the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>by the glossator. The enhanced attention paid to this text is characteristic of trends in thirteenth-century education when this work, which contained more practical information relevant to judicial rhetoric, was intensively studied. This diagram, added on <strong>f. 63r</strong>, exemplifies this interest in legal matters as it summarises the types of law enumerated in <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium, </em>II.XIII.19: natural law, statute law, custom, precedent, equityand agreement.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_62_r_62_r_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Following the text</h2><p>The majority of the schemata follow the text closely, even slavishly. This scheme on f. 55r summarises types of narrative (Rhetorica ad Herennium, I.VIII.12-13). In the text, these features of the narrative are successively subdivided and enumerated. The scheme basically connects these subdivisions into one, allowing the reader to follow the argument at a glance. It doesn’t add extra information to the text, but presumably helped the reader understand and recollect the parts of a narrative.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_55_r_55_r_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Adding to the text</h2><p>There are only two instances where the schemata add information to the text. Here a list of circumstances (‘quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxilius, cur, quando’, ‘who, what, where, with whom, why, when’) has been added to the left part of a scheme depicting the divisions of plausible narratives (Rhetorica ad Herennium, I.IX.16). The list, probably well-known to the reader, chimes with the subject of the passage, and would have helped add colour to any account of an event.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_56_r_56_r_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Another list, threading down the side of the text (Rhetorica ad Herennium, II.III.3-5), enumerates the attributes of persons: name, nature, manner of life, fortune, habit, feeling, interests, purposes, achievements, accidents, speeches made. This list, which is lifted from De inventione II.17-28, serves to connect the two texts in the mind of the reader and adds relevant (albeit not particularly innovative) material to the discussion of ways to make an argument sound more plausible.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_59_v_59_v_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Form serves function</h2><p>This  scheme of the parts of advantage ‘utile’ (glossing Rhetorica ad Herennium, III.II.3) shows how the schemata serve a double function of summarising the text as well as pointing the reader to relevant sections. By elongating the scheme (using wavy connecting lines between the textual elements) the glossator ensures that its divisions are, by and large, adjacent to the part of the text to which they pertain. This allows the reader to quickly find the relevant divisions in the text, transforming the scheme into a sort of roadmap to this passage.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_71_r_71_r_fr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Boethius: De differentiis topicis, Book IV</h2><p>The two rhetorical texts by and attributed to Cicero are separated in the manuscript by a short work, the fourth book of Boethius’s De differentiis topicis. Whereas the rest of Boethius’s De differentiis topicis deals with logic, this part tackles rhetorical argumentation, particularly Cicero’s theory of the circumstances defining a case (who, what, where, when, why, how, and by what means).The text was a popular match to Cicero’s work, while its short length meant that it could easily be added to a rhetorical compendium without overly increasing its length; here, for example, it takes up seven leaves of parchment (ff. 46r-52v), so requires less than a full regular quire of eight leaves.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_46_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Glossing Boethius’s De differentiis topicis, Book IV</h2><p>This part of the text (f. 47v)  is glossed by a hand which is not active in the rest of the manuscript, but also dates to the thirteenth century. We can see some examples of the glossator’s technique here. First, he transliterates a Greek word, writing ‘thesim’, ‘thesis’, above it. In the longer section, he indicates in the margin that this  pertains to the parts of oratory, and then distinguishes the elements of the list in the text with lines. Finally, he clarifies what the pronoun ‘eisdem’ refers to here, that is, to the species of rhetoric. In short, he clarifies the text for the reader.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-103_47_v_47_v_fr }}
