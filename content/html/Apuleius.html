<h2>Apuleius’ Peri hermeneias<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></h2><p>Apuleius was a Platonist philosopher and rhetorician active in the second century CE. Born in Madaura, in the Roman province Africa, he was educated at Carthage and Athens, and taught rhetoric in Rome before returning to Africa. He is an exponent of the period known as the Second Sophistic, an age of cultural flowering characterized by a revived interest in the study of ancient Greek rhetoric and philosophy. The <em>Peri hermeneias </em>(also known as <em>De interpretatione</em> or ‘On Interpretation’) is a short handbook of formal logic that deals with the Aristotelian logical doctrine. It has a Greek title, but is, in fact, the earliest Latin logical treatise that is known. The text is an exposition of categorical logic, which uses simple categorical propositions (such as ‘all men are mortal’) to deduce necessary conclusions. [Link to Irene O’Daly, Diagrams I, II] The principal subject of the text is the relation between subjects, predicates and propositions, as well as a classification of the various types of propositions. The work includes the Aristotelian square of opposition in order to describe how different propositions relate to each other. [link to Irene O’Daly, Diagrams I] It was important for the transmission of Greek logical thought to the medieval Latin West and for the Latinisation of Greek technical terms. Apuleius made a fair amount of logical theory available to medieval readers. The <em>Peri hermeneias</em> served as an aid, together with Boethius’ commentaries [Link to other portrait], to understand the logical texts of Aristotle.<br /></p><p>[[[apuleius.jpg]]]</p><p>Source used for this contribution: Bobzien, Susanne, "Ancient Logic", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Summer 2020 Edition), Edward N.
