<p>±col1±</p><p>This early tenth-century manuscript of logical works displays an abundance of glosses. It is a veritable treasure trove that tells us much about the reception of logic and rational argumentation. The different users of this manuscript put much effort in creating a rich dossier of knowledge pertaining to the art of reasoning, and drew in snippets of useful knowledge from a variety of sources and traditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>±col2±</p><p>The manuscript was copied in the early tenth century and belonged to the library of St-Germain in Auxerre, where it had the shelf mark N. 1108 (olim 442).

As can be seen clearly in this photo, offering a view of the tail of the codex, the quires have various dimensions. On the left, quires 1 to 4, containing Aristotle’s <em>Periermeneias</em> and the densely annotated  <em>Categoriae decem </em>(dimensions: 250-255 x 200), on the right, quires 5 and 6 (dimensions 270 x 220). Quire 6 contains Boethius’ <em>Opuscula sacra.</em> Inserts are attached to the spine to compensate for the difference in size. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[12949tail.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The glosses in this manuscript go back to, or can be associated with different masters: John Scot Eriugena, Heiric of Auxerre, Israel Scotus (aka Israel the Grammarian)  and a certain Aldelm who was probably also an Irish scholar [Contreni, 1977]. The manuscript is richly annotated by several hands. Some notes are contemporary to the hand of the main text, others are slightly later. Throughout the codex slips of parchment have been inserted. A remarkable feature of the layout of the glosses in this manuscript is that the notes are not only written horizontally but also vertically, across the length of the page - a very economic use of space</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-12949notes }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The first page, with Aristotle’s <em>On Interpretation</em> (<em>Peri Hermeneias</em>) invited quite a number of annotations, but they peter out on the next pages.
