It is a veritable treasure trove that tells us much about the reception of logic and rational argumentation. The different users of this manuscript put much effort in creating a rich dossier of knowledge pertaining to the art of reasoning, and drew in snippets of useful knowledge from a variety of sources and traditions. The manuscript was copied in the early tenth century and belonged to the library of St-Germain in Auxerre, where it had the shelf mark N. 1108 (olim 442). The codex was restored in 1977. </p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[12949side.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Paris, BnF, lat. 12949 is a composite manuscript consisting of six quires. As can be seen clearly in this photo, which offers a view of the tail of the codex, the quires have various dimensions. On the left, we see quires 1 to 4 (dimensions: 250-255 x 200), containing Aristotle’s <em>Periermeneias</em> and the <em>Categoriae decem</em>, on the right quires 5 and 6 (dimensions 270 x 220), containing Porphyry’s <em>Isagoge</em> and  Boethius’ <em>Opuscula sacra</em>. Inserts are attached to the spine to compensate for the difference in size.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[12949tail.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The glosses in this manuscript go back to, or can be associated with different masters: <a href="http://john-scot#scot">John Scottus Eriugena</a>, <a href="http://auxerre#auxerre">Heiric of Auxerre</a>, Israel Scotus (aka Israel the Grammarian)  and a certain Aldelm who was probably also an Irish scholar.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> The manuscript is richly annotated by several hands. Some notes are contemporary to the hand of the main text, others are slightly later. Throughout the codex slips of parchment have been inserted. A remarkable feature of the layout of the glosses in this manuscript is that the notes are not only written horizontally but also vertically, across the length of the page; a very economic use of space.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-12949notes }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The first page, with Aristotle’s <em>On Interpretation</em> (<em>Peri Hermeneias</em>) invited quite a number of annotations, but they peter out on the next pages. Aristotle’s <em>On Interpretation </em>deals with the relationship between language and reality. This work would receive much attention in the twelfth century, but not so much yet in the early tenth century, when this manuscript was annotated. </p><p>In the right margin is the red circular stamp of the Bibliothèque nationale.  </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_1_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On folio 12 recto we find Augustine’s <em>Dialectica, </em>a brief exposition on the ambiguity of language and the etymology of words<em>. </em>Augustine said he never finished the <em>Dialectica</em> and lost his only copy of the manuscript. For this reason, Augustine’s authorship of the text has long been in doubt, but is now commonly accepted.

From the eighth to eleventh century the <em>Categoriae decem </em>drew by far the most attention of scholars and students interested in logic.

Perhaps the notes were made by a student, scholar or master for personal use and recollection on a scrap of parchment that travelled with this manuscript and was at some point inserted into the codex.
