<p>±col1±</p><h2>A rich dossier on the art of reasoning<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></h2><p>Paris, BnF, lat. 12949 is a composite manuscript consisting of six quires of varying dimensions, as can be clearly seen in the image on the right. The manuscript was restored in 1977. The glosses in this manuscript go back to, or can be associated with different masters: ±a±2js±a±, ±a±2sa±a±,, Israel Scotus (aka Israel the Grammarian)  and a certain Aldelm who was probably also an Irish scholar [Contreni, 1977]</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[12949side.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Paris, BnF, lat. 12949 contains a number of logical works and three of Boethius’ theological treatises known as the <em>Opuscula sacra. </em>It was copied in the early tenth century and belonged to the library of St-Germain in Auxerre, where it had the shelf mark N. 1108 (olim 442).</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[olim442.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The manuscript is richly annotated by several hands. Some notes are contemporary to the hand of the main text, others are slightly later. Throughout the codex slips of parchment have been inserted (12 in total), providing extra comments to the text. Perhaps they were added because every inch of the page was already filled with notes and more space was needed, but there is also another explanation (see below). A remarkable feature of the layout of the glosses in this manuscript is that the notes are not only written horizontally but also vertically, across the length of the page - a very economic use of space.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-12949notes }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Although the first page invited quite a number of annotations, they peter out on the next pages.

In the early middle ages it was ascribed to Augustine, and taken to be a translation of Aristotle’s work rather than a paraphrase. From the eighth to eleventh the <em>Categoriae decem </em>drew by far the most attention of scholars and students interested in logic. This interest is also evident from the many annotations the text received this early tenth-century manuscript. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_24_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Above the  opening of the text is the verse preface that Alcuin added to the <em>Categoriae decem, </em>addressed to King Charlemagne. Alcuin was responsible for the re-circulationof the <em>Ten Categories</em> in the late eighth century, when interest in logic and especailly in the relation between language, logic and ontology increased in the aftermath of the debate with Byzantium on the veneration of images. Alcuin may have been the first to ascribe the <em>Ten Categories</em> to Augustine. His dedicatory verses to Charlemagne have been added to the <em>Categoriae decem </em>in the majority of manuscripts that transmit this work, including the oldest manuscript, Vatican, BAV, Pagès 1, dated between 780 and 813.

In the ninth and tenth centuries, however, the <em>Periphyseon</em> was considered the pinnacle of learning.

The verses and statements assembled here have no direct relationship to any of the texts in this codex, apart from the reoccurrence of familiar names. Perhaps the notes were made by a student, scholar or master for personal use and recollection on a scrap of parchment that travelled with this manuscript and was at some point inserted into the codex. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-12949f23bisrfr }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The glosses consist mainly of excerpts from Boethius’s commentaries, Isidore of Seville, Alcuin’s <em>De dialectica </em>and Macrobius <em>Commentary on the Dream of Scipio. </em>These glosses are attributed to a certain ICPA.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_46_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>f.52v: “I, Icpa, wrote this little book, glossing it in some way  - Icpa <em>[rasura</em>] hunc scripsi glossas utcunque libellum” Édouard Jeanneau has proposed that ‘Icpa’ is the Latin transliteration of the Greek kapital letters ΙΞΡΑ (ISRA) and refers to Israel the Grammarian (c. 895 – c. 965).

This opening page of <em>De Trinitate ad Symmachum</em> (f. 53r) has some glosses, but the next folia are virtually empty. At first glance this is somewhat surprising, for it is here that readers could have learned how to apply the theory of logical argumentation in practice.  Boethius’ <em>Against Eutychus and Nestorius</em> for example (ff. 62v-70v) demonstrates how categorical logic can be used against heretics. Where are the glosses and notes of the students and scholars who were so eager to fill the margins of the previous quires? Were they not interested in the practical application of logic? That may have been the case, but there is also another explanation for the absence of notes. These quires with Boethius’ <em>Opuscula sacra </em>make up a separate codicological unit that was only later bound together with the other quires. Perhaps they were added to the fully annotated set after the annotators had stopped their active study of the texts. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_53_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>As can be seen clearly in this photo,offering a view of the tail of the codex, the quires have various dimensions.
