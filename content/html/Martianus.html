<p>±col1span±</p><h2>Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</em></h2><p>Martianus Capella is a fifth-century author from Carthago, North Africa, which was then a province of the Roman empire until the Vandals took over in 439 AD. Only one of his works survived: a work titled <em>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</em>, “About the marriage of Philology and Mercury”. The work narrates the story of the god Mercury, who is looking for a suitable bride and finds her in the earthly lady Philology, a personification of all earthly knowledge and science. In this allegory, Mercury stands for heavenly knowledge, but also for the body of knowledge connected to <em>language</em>, or the <em>trivium</em>. Philology symbolically represents knowledge connected to <em>number</em>, or the <em>quadrivium</em>. Together, the couple personifies perfect knowledge. In the story, the couple receives an allegorically fitting gift from the gods to celebrate their marriage: seven ladies come to present their knowledge at the banquet. The ladies are personifications of the seven Liberal Arts, the arts of <em>trivium</em> and <em>quadrivium</em>. Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic are the three arts of language, Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy and Music are the four arts of number. For the medieval art of reasoning Martianus’ <em>De nuptiis</em> is crucial, because he is one of the most important sources for the establishment of the curriculum of the Seven Liberal Arts. Moreover, his treatment of the art of Dialectic provoked elaborate commentaries.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[martianus.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>Mariken Teeuwen<br />Source: <br />W.H.
