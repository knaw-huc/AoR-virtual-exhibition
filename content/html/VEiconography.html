<p>±col1±</p><h2>Treacherous or respectable? The iconography of dialectica </h2><p>In late antiquity dialectica met with suspicion. Heated disputations had disrupted thecouncils of the early church, with the result that dialectica itself came to be considered a threat to the unity andstability of christian communities. This suspicion lived on in the early middle ages. With the rise of the scholastic method, however, dialectica’s reputation improved considerably. This development is reflected in the verbal imagery and pictorial representations of dialectica, and in particular in the iconography of Lady Dialectic. The following images show dialectica’s metamorphosis from treacherous woman to queen of the Trivium.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[dialectica.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Traditionally, dialectica was associated with imagery of violence and military battle. Attributed to the philosopher Zeno is the saying: Rhetoric is an open hand, dialectic a clenched fist. In this late ninth, early tenth century manuscript of logical texts, Paris, BnF, lat, 12949. Zeno’s saying is added in the blank space preceding Augustine’s De dialectica. It is accompanied by a nota sign.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-12949f12rfr2 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>One of the oldest descriptions of Lady dialectica as a dangerous and untrustworthy woman can be found in Martianus Capella’s encyclopedia of the liberal arts, dating to the early fifth century. In this illustration in a tenth-century manuscript, that closely follows Martianus’ description, Lady Dialectica holds a wax tablet with attractive premises for discussion to draw her opponents near.  When they are close enough, she reels them in with a hook. Hidden snakes come out of her sleeve to attack and kill her opponents. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_132_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>It is worth looking into the details of this description and the comments it invited in the ninth century. John Scot and Remigius of Auxerre (see famous teachers) commented on Lady Dialectica’s appearance, attire and attitude. Their comments reveal their opinion on dialectic and the risks of dialectical argumentation.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_133_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Martianus “her intricate coiffure seemed beautifully curled and bound together, and descending by successive stages, it so encompassed the shape of her whole head” John Scot’s comment on the ‘intricate’ style of her hair: Her premises for discussion (<em>propositiones</em>) are intricate, deceitful and seductive Remigius of Auxerre’s comment: Intricate and interwoven hair stands for deceitful and seductive <em>propositiones.</em></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[dialecticahead.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Martinanus: “In her right hand she held a set of inference patterns <em>(formulae</em>), carefully inscribed on wax tablets” The object that Dialectia is holding in this illustration looks much like a hornbook, in use from about 1450. It was used as a primer for study, displaying the alphabet or short religious texts or creeds.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-hornbook }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Martianius: “The set of patterns was held on the inside by a hidden hook” Remigius of Auxerre: “The patterns indicate a simple premise for discussion. The hook however stands for a harmful, ensnaring conclusion” Note how the illustrator has moved the hook from Dialectica’s right hand (where Martianus placed it) to her left. Perhaps he or she considered it impossible to hold tablets ánd a hook in one hand. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[dialecticahook.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Martianus: </p><p>In her left hand she held a snake entwined in immense coils […] since her left hand kept de crafty device of the snake hidden under her cloak, her right hand was offered to one and all. Then if anyone took one of those premises he was soon caught and dragged toward the poisonous coils of the hidden snake, which presently emerged and after first biting the man relentlessly with the venomous points of its sharp teeth, then gripped him in his many coils and compelled him to the intended position. If no one wanted to take the premises, Dialectia confronted them with some questions, or secretly stirred the snake to creep up on them until its tight embrace strangled those who were caught and compelled them to accept the will of their interrogator.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[dialecticasnake.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>John Scot on Dialectica’s serpent:  The serpent stands for the sharpness of sophisms (Per serpentem, sophisticas subtilitates intellige) Sophistic argumentation represented the dark side of dialectic. Although it was acknowledged that dialectic <em>could</em> be used as a critical tool to distinguish true from false, sophisms (a clever but false argument, used deliberately to deceive) were the object of distrust</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[serpent.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Perhaps it was hardly surprising that dialectica was associated with the misleading and treacherous charms of the serpent. After all, it was the serpent who seduced Eve and Adam to eat from the tree of knowledge, so they would be like God and know the distincion between good and evil. Dialectica made a similar promise as the serpent: teaching to distiniguish between true and false. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[adameve.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>The serpent as symbol of heresy </h2><p>Dialectica’s serpent sprang from an association of dialectic with venom, which was in turn associated with heretics: experts in false and misleading reasoning. Church father Ambrose contrasted the dialectical, venomous disputations of Arian heretics to the simple faith of Christians “For they [the heretics] store up all the strength of their poisons in dialectical disputation, which by the judgment of philosophers is defined as having no power to build anything; it only aims at destruction. For it was not by dialectic that it pleased God to save his people. The kingdom of God resides in simplicity of faith, not in contention of words.” <sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[prosper.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In this Paris manuscript of logical texts dating to c. 1140 we see that Lady Dialectica’s status has improved, now that logic is studied in cathedral schools and holds a solid place in the school curriculum ±a±1cu±a± . Dialectica stands on a footstool and is wearing a crown. Above her head is written ‘dialectica domina’. Her left hand still holds the serpent. But the beast is no longer hidden under her cloak as a treacherous weapon but held openly and proudly, as if it were a scepter. In her right hand, the tablets with attractive premises, described by Martianus, have been replaced  by a porphyrian tree. ±a±3ds± This is a significant change of attribute.

Logic can be used for good and for bad. In his words: “the one hand provokes laughter, the other ends with tears, the one captures, the other chases away, the one moves, the other poisons, the one anoints, the other stings” Like Martianus’ Lady Dialectica, Alanus’ Maiden Logica is an untrustworthy woman. Her right hand, her good side, in the end only serves the treacherous intentions of the left hand<em>: manus sinistra</em> - her  ‘sinister’ side.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Maiden Logica has many faces. Even her scorpion is two-faced. See the earlier description Alanus gives of the pair in <em>The Complaint of Nature</em> (<em>De planctu naturae</em>) (c. 1160) “The faces of the third (Logica) turned and alternated, now promised a kindly clearness, now gave itself up to the clouds of obscurity. On this the figure of a scorpion stood out, and foretold with its face laughter, with the sting of its tail tears.”</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>From the 12th century onwards, stone carvings of Lady dialectica and her sisters from the liberal arts can be found in portals of cathedrals, for example in Laon, Auxerre and in Chartres. The iconography and location attest to the status of the artes as resources of knowledge of God’s creation. Scholasticism is often directly associated with Gothic architecture, harmonizing Christan theology with Aristotelian methods of logical argument and debate.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-chartres }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Dialectica holds he index and middle finger of her right hand against the flat of her left hand.
