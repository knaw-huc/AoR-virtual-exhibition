<p>±col1span±</p><h2>Boethius’ <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em></h2><p>Boethius wrote his <em>Consolation</em> around the year 523. The book is a dialogue between Lady Philosophy and himself. Philosophy consoles him in the hard times he had fallen on: accused of treason, he was incarcerated and in 524 executed by the King of the Ostrogoths Theoderic the Great. In the book, Philosophy emphasizes the transient meaning of earthly fortune, such as fame and wealth, and argues for the superiority of things of the mind: happiness comes from within, from wisdom and understanding. The book engages with Christian themes such as free will and predestination, but approaches these from the perspective of natural philosophy and Greek classical philosophy alone. It is an example in how to apply ancient philosophical ideas to a discourse which is very Christian in nature. The book was very popular in the Western literary tradition. Many copies survive, together with translations, commentaries and adaptations.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[boethiusphilosophy.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>Mariken Teeuwen<br />Source: <br />Marenbon, John, "Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N.
