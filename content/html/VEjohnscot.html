<p>±col1±</p><h2>John ‘the Scot Eriugena’</h2><p>John ‘the Scot Eriugena’ (c.815-c.877)  was a peculiar figure in ninth-century intellectual life. It is not sure whether he was a monk, and he was certainly not an abbot or bishop. He was educated in Ireland and came to the court of Charles the Bald around 845 as head of his Palace School, just as Alcuin ±a±2ad±a± had been in the time of Charlemagne.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[scottus.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>John the Scot is most known for his work Periphyseon (On the Division of Nature): a dialogue ±a±2ad±a± between a master and a pupil about the four divisions of nature: that which creates and is not created; that is created and creates; that which is created and does not create; that which is neither created nor creates. The method of reasoning is the syllogism ±a±3sy±a±: a basic model for logical reasoning.</p><p>Here we see the model simplified and captured in opposites (<em>contrariae</em>) by Honorius of Autun in the 12th century, in his <em>Clavis physicae</em>.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[6734f2r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>John the Scot the scholar and his assistent ‘Nisifortinus</h2><p>John Scottus had a great interest in anything Greek. In manuscripts we recognize his presence by notes annotating and translating Greek passages. Here we see an annotation in the lower margin written by John Scottus himself (we know his autograph): he adds a Greek passage from Homerus’ Odysseus and adds a latin translation above the Greek words. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[bpl67f32v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>John the Scot’s hand in manuscripts is often accompanied by a second hand, similar but not quite the same. It has been argued that this hand in the hand of his close assistant,who worked for him and with him.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> We know him by the nickname of Nisifortinus, ‘But perhaps’… Whereas John was not afraid to take bold and controversial positions, his assistant worked hard to soften his statements and make them acceptable.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>This is a cartoon made by Randall Rosenfeld, which illustrates an anecdote reported (and invented?) by William of Malmesbury (†1143). King Charles the Bald and John the Scot (Eriugena) were seated at the same table, and the King said: “What separates a Sot from a Scot?” To which John answered: “Only a table.” And ‘Nisifortinus’ softens the insult with: “Unless, perhaps, anyone shall say that...”</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[cartoonrosenfeld.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Just as for John Scottus himself, we are in the rare circumstance that we know the handwriting of ‘Nisifortinus’. The two operated together on several manuscripts, the master adding corrections and notes, the student copying the master’s comments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>±col2±</p><p>In this manuscript with the text of Martianus Capella’s On the marriage of Mercury and Philology, Leiden, UB, BPL 88 ±a±m88±a±, we find ‘Nisifortinus’ making notes to a part of the text. The philosophical language of John Scottus and his Periphyseon is clearly recognizable: the gloss says, roughly translated, that ‘pure thinking’ is the only way to reach full understanding of the concept of number. The preoccupation with ancient Greek philosophy is also clear: we see Greek words and Greek names such as Theophrastus and Pythagoras.</p><p>±col3±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl88_172_v }}<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> (Dutton &amp; Jeaneau), <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p> (Jeauneau, Édouard, and Paul Edward Dutton, <em>The autograph of Eriugena</em>, Corpus Christianorum, Medieval Latin Series, Autographa Medii Aeui 3, Turnhout: Brepols, 1996). <a href="#footnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li></ol>
