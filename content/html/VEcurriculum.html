<p>±col1±</p><h2>What was taught in medieval schools? The Curriculum</h2><p>In the Carolingian period (ca 780-900), known for its efforts to revive and stimulate education, a teaching programme was promoted which included first and foremost christian learning: knowledge of the bible and the liturgy and the works of the church fathers. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>With that, however, a whole heritage of prechristian and late-antique learning was also adopted into the curriculum: the Roman poets for their beautiful and complex Latin, the Greek philosophers (in Latin translation) for their systems of understanding the world. The ancient division of learning into seven key disciplines, the seven liberal arts, was also embraced by the medieval world: these became a core element.</p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[231p276.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The seven liberal arts<br />In the late-ancient and early medieval knowledge tradition, the body of knowledge (or wisdom, sapientia) was divided up into fields (artes or disciplinae) to make the whole more managable. For the Latin middle ages, the division into seven liberal arts, as found in the works of Martianus Capella and Boethius, was most influential. These seven liberal arts were in turn divided into the three arts of language (trivium) and the four arts of number (quadrivium).</p><p>±col2±</p><p>In the image on the bottom left, several divisions of knowledge can be seen from Cassiodorus’ Institutiones, a manual for all divine and worldly learning. In the circle you see the division of the arts of number into four disciplines: arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[cassiodorus.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The arts of language: Trivium<br />Three disciplines formed the art of language: Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic.<br />Grammar covered the basics: young students were introduced into letters, reading and writing, in Latin. One of the basic handbooks used for a first introduction was Donatus, Ars minor. More advanced handbooks were also studied on a higher level: Donatus’ Ars maior and Priscian’s Institutiones grammaticae. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf790_127_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In this late 12<sup>th</sup> century manuscript of a part of Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis</em>, the Trivium, personified as three wise ladies, is depicted at the opening of the text.

It contains the first five books of <em>De nuptiis</em>, together with the commentary of Remigius of Auxerre ±a±2sa±a±, who is perhaps also portrayed in the large initial on the right:</p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[genevieve.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[genevieve2.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Lady Grammar has a bundle of rods in her hand, to chastise the student who is sitting in front of her. His upper body is already half bared to receive his punishment. In the open booklet on his lap we can read the word ‘partes orationis’, ‘parts of speech’. In the middle, Lady Dialectic is holding a snake, to symbolize the treacherousness of argumentation. On the right, Lady Rhetoric is holding arrows and a shield, symbolizing the weapons one needs to yield in a debate.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[genevieve3.jpg]]]</p>
