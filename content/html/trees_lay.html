The remaining categories are ‘accidents’, these are the properties of the substance, they describe <em>how</em> something is, properties which are not necessarily essential to <em>what</em> it is (e.g. ‘Socrates is sitting’; Socrates could equally be standing, but he would still be Socrates).</p><p>±col3±</p><p>Porphyry, a third-century Greek philosopher, wrote an important work called the <em>Isagoge</em>, which was an introduction to Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em>. This work was later translated into Latin and commented upon by Boethius.</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>One of the important contributions of this work was a treatment of the first, and most important of Aristotle’s categories, substance. Porphyry investigated what substance consisted of by using *<em>differentiae</em> – looking at the essential features which distinguish one *<em>species</em> within a *<em>genus</em> from another. This process of distinguishing between genera was often visualised in medieval manuscripts in the form of a tree diagram.<br /></p><p>Porphyry identifies five ‘predicables’, genus, species, differentiae, property and accident. This scheme shows what makes each predicable different from the others.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_139_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>How can we use categories to reason about the world?</h2><p>The ‘Porphyrian tree’ is a way to divide a category, genus, into its constituents, and in so doing work out what the sub-genera and species which make up this category consist of. It is a tool for thinking about what things are and working out what are the essential characteristics of particular species.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_53_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1± </p><p>At each point <em>differentiae</em> (e.g. ‘is it corporeal or not?’) are used to establish characteristics.  Note – in this case the tree is worked out to a particular conclusion – to identify the characteristics of the human species. A human (with particular examples given here as Socrates, Plato, Cicero) is mortal, rational, sensitive, animate, corporeal and made of substance. But the scheme also identifies other genera which describe the living world. For example, a sensitive, animate, corporeal substance is, in other words, an animal, while an insensitive, animate, corporeal substance, is a plant.</p><p>It’s important to note that all of Aristotle’s categories could be expanded into ‘trees’ using the process of differentiation, but the category of substance was the one which was most commonly executed.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf165_37_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The ‘Porphyrian tree’ was co-opted into different textual contexts. For example, in this example, a version of the Porphyrian tree is incorporated into a thirteenth-century manuscript of John of Damascus’ <em>Logica</em> (BnF lat. 16598, f. 37r). This manuscript was donated to the library at the Sorbonne by Gerard d’Abbeville [[[Abbeville.docx]]], a thirteenth-century master. Here, as might befit a book belonging to a theologian, Peter and Paul substitute for Plato and Socrates as examples of the species ‘man’.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>±f±bnf770_52_r±f± </p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In this twelfth-century manuscript of Boethius’ commentary on the <em>Topica</em> of Cicero (Link to BnF lat. 7709, f. 52r – see form) a glossator has added a small schemes similar to a Porphyrian tree beside the discussion of species and genus in the text. The scheme, entitled ‘<em>substantia</em>’ (substance) gives the genera: substance, body animate, animal, man and ends with the example of Socrates. Here Porphyry’s tree is transported from its original textual context and used in an abbreviated form – presumably to help the reader recall the method of logical differentiation.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Why is it called a ‘tree’?</h2><p>Depicting the process of differentiation as branching creates an image which looks like a tree, even though its root (in this case substance) is at its head! The similarity in form between the scheme and a tree was not lost on medieval scribes… In this manuscript, a copy of <em>Decem categoriae</em>, a text on the categories attributed in the medieval period to Augustine, a branching diagram similar to a Porphyrian tree has been added in the margin, complete with foliate details.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>±f±bnf129_24_v±f± </p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Usia [substance, a Latin form of the Greek οὐσία]<br />Animal / Genus<br />Homo / Species<br />Cicero / Estheti [to feel?]</p><p>The tradition of referring to the ’Porphyrian tree’ as a tree can be traced back to the thirteenth century. The famous logical text book, <em>Summulae logicales</em> by Peter of Spain described ‘<em>arbor Porphyriana’</em> and copies of the text were frequently illustrated with depictions of the Porphyrian tree as a tree – complete with leaves and branches. Like <strong>BnF lat. 16598</strong>, this manuscript was also part of the bequest of <strong>Gerard d’Abbeville</strong> to the library of the Sorbonne in the thirteenth century.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf166_8_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Other ways of using schemes to think about the nature of being</h2><p>The Porphyrian tree was just one example of how medieval scholars grappled with thinking about the nature of being.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>±f±bpl88_62_r±f± </p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1± </p><p>In these two copies of Martianus Capella’s De <em>nuptiis</em>… [link to Mariken] a small marginal diagram is appended to the section on dialectic. </p><p>±col2± </p><p>Circular in form, at its centre it has the  word ‘homo’, ‘man’ then<em> ‘animalitas’</em>, <em>‘ratio’, ‘mortalitas’, ‘sensus’</em> – animality (i.e. being animate), reason, mortality and senstation – in the next circle.
