<p>±col1±</p><h2>Reasoning through syllogism</h2><p>Propositions and syllogisms are the foundations of medieval logical reasoning. Derived from the writings of Aristotle – notably the <em>De interpretatione</em> [<em>logica vetus</em>] and the <em>Prior analytics</em> [<em>logica nova</em>] – in the translations of Apuleius and Boethius, propositions (<em>link to explanation in square of opposition</em>) and syllogisms provided a methodology for constructing a logical argument.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl84_63_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>How do propositions relate to syllogisms?</h2><p>The square of opposition allows you to relate propositions that have the same subject and predicate (here ‘man’, ‘being just’). But what happens when you have more than two terms, or want to relate propositions with different subjects or predicates? A syllogism is another way of relating propositions and formally consists of two propositions and a conclusion.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>One term is common to both propositions, or premise, and to the conclusion. By reasoning from what is common between the premises you can come to a reasoned conclusion. For example:  Every horse is an animal. Some horses are white. Therefore, some animals are white.</p><p>±col3±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl25_12_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Moods of syllogisms</h2><p>Aristotle identified nineteen different ‘moods’ or patterns of syllogisms, which he divided into three ‘figures’, or groupings, with each figure involving a different arrangement of subject and predicate in the premise. In this manuscript (<strong>BPL 84, f. 63r</strong>, a copy of Boethius’ work <em>Introductio ad syllogismos categoricis</em>), we can see an exposition of these three figures. They are numbered alongside the text in the inner margin and red brackets and rubrics are used to distinguish them.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl84_63_rb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Remembering the moods of  syllogisms</h2><p>In order to remember the nineteen moods of syllogisms, medieval logicians came up with a short verse which ‘encoded’ the details of each of the three figures:</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Barbara Celarent Darii Ferio Baralipton</p><p>Celantes Dabitis Fapesmo Friesomorum</p><p>Cesare Cambestres Festino Barocho Darapti</p><p>Felapto Disamis Datisi Bocardo Ferison</p><p>±col3±</p><p>To understand how this worked let us look at our first example of the first figure:</p><p>‘All that is just is good. All that is virtuous is just. Therefore, all that is virtuous is good.’</p><p>This syllogism consists of two universal affirmative premises and a universal affirmative conclusion.</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>This syllogism is represented by the word ‘Barbara’, where the three vowels ‘a, a, a’ indicate that this is a syllogism made up for three universal affirmatives (represented by ‘a’, taken from ‘affirmo’)</p><p>The vowel ‘e’ represents a universal negative (taken from ‘nego’), while i and o represent the particular affirmative and the particular negative respectively (with i taken from ‘affirmo’ and o from ‘nego’)</p><p>±col2±</p><p>An influential account of the moods of the syllogisms, popularizing this verse is found in Peter of Spain’s Summulae. In this manuscript, BnF lat. 16611, given to the Sorbonne by the thirteenth-century master, Gerard de Abbeville±a±2ab±a±, the names of the syllogisms have been added in the space between the two columns of text.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[16611f14v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Playing with syllogisms I: Leiden UB, BPL 88</h2><p>This bifolium (f. 1v – 2r) was attached to the ninth-century portion of BPL 88 as a set of flyleaves. We know it became appended to the Martianus text in the eleventh century at the latest, as on f. 2r an eleventh-century hand has added an ‘accessus’, a short introductory text, adding detail about Martianus and his writings, suggesting that by this point the bifolium and text were joined. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl88_1_vb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On f. 1v-2r a scribe has added a series of ‘squares of oppositions’ and syllogisms; at first these look like the scribe is experimenting with the possibilities of the ‘square of opposition’. It’s tempting to think of this as an exercise sheet – perhaps evidence of a student trying out various options!</p><p>±col2±</p><p>However, when we look closely at the content we find that the collection of schemes is far from random. All of these sets of propositions can be found in Boethius’ first commentary on his translation of Aristotle’s  De interpretatione (= Peri Hermeneias). Compare BPL 25 [link] where these sets of propositions (with the exception of the last) are found in the margins. The bifolium is, effectively, a diagrammatic summary of De interpretatione!</p><p>±col3±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl88_1_vc }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>The scribe has gathered all these sets of propositions into one place. Was he a student, making a medieval ‘crib sheet’, looking to memorise all the propositions from the text, perhaps wanting to have all the schemes to hand in one place as he worked his way through Boethius’ complex text? </p><p>Another possibility is that this bifolium could be a draft sheet for a scribe; the fact that the second scheme on f. 1v duplicates and corrects the content of the first suggests that this sheet could represent ‘work in progress’. The unfinished zodiacal scheme on f. 2r might lead us to the same conclusion. Schemes were not easy to plan and draw and draft sheets must have been made, although they rarely survive.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Playing with syllogisms II: Leiden UB, BPL 139 (Paris BnF lat. 6638)</h2><p>This manuscript contains a ‘wheel of syllogisms’, an alternate means of representing the relationship between propositions than the ’square of opposition’.The wheel is found at the conclusion of a copy of Apuleius’ (c. 123 – 170) exposition on Aristotle’s Peri hermenias. </p><p>±col2±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl139_39_vb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The wheel represents a portion of Apuleius’ text: ‘It is clear that someone who has proposed something asserts to it.

However it is established in one way: if its contradictory is shown to be false. On the other hand a particular proposition is destroyed in one way: if its contradictory is shown to be true.

This manuscript [link to it] contains a fragment of De syllogismis hypotheticis of Abbo of Fleury (f. 1va-4rb), followed by Apuleius’ work. Here the scheme is added on a small piece of parchment now bound into the manuscript. Unlike the copy in BPL 139 B, this copy could have been rotated, allowing the reader to follow the propositions around the wheel more easily. The fact that it was copied on a small sheet suggests that this might have been a study aid, a loose piece of parchment to have to hand while reading Apuleius’ text.</p><p>±col3±</p>{{> folios/folio-6638 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Playing with syllogisms III: Leiden UB, VLF 48</h2><p>Here two scribes have used the blank space at the end of this manuscript of Martianus Capella’s De Nuptiis as a space for writing some notes: this shows how ‘unused’ space could become a venue in which material only tangentially related to the content of the codex was gathered.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-vlf48_95_vb }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The first scheme is a ‘proof’ of the utility of dialectic.
