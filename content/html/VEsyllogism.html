<h2>Reasoning through syllogism</h2>
<p>Propositions and syllogisms are the foundations of medieval logical reasoning. Derived from the writings of Aristotle – notably the <em>De interpretatione</em> [<em>logica vetus</em>] and the <em>Prior analytics</em> [<em>logica nova</em>] – in
  the translations of Apuleius and Boethius, propositions (<em>link to explanation in square of opposition</em>) and syllogisms provided a methodology for constructing a logical argument.</p>

<h2>How do propositions relate to syllogisms?</h2>
<p>The <strong>square of opposition </strong>allows you to relate propositions that have the same subject and predicate (here ‘man’, ‘being just’). But what happens when you have more than two terms, or want to relate propositions with different
  subjects or predicates? A syllogism is another way of relating propositions and formally consists of two propositions and a conclusion.One term is common to both propositions (or premise) and to the conclusion. By reasoning from what is common
  between the premises you can come to a reasoned conclusion. For example: </p>
<p>Every horse is an animal. Some horses are white. Therefore, some animals are white.</p>

<h2>Moods of syllogisms</h2>
<p>Aristotle identified nineteen different ‘moods’ or patterns of syllogisms, which he divided into three ‘figures’, or groupings, with each figure involving a different arrangement of subject and predicate in the premise. In this manuscript
  (<strong>Leiden UB, BPL 84, f. 63r</strong>, a copy of Boethius’s work <em>Introductio ad syllogismos categoricos</em>), we can see an exposition of the moods of first figure syllogisms. They are numbered alongside the text in the inner margin and
  red brackets and rubrics are used to distinguish them.</p>

<h2>Remembering the moods of syllogisms</h2>
<p>In order to remember the nineteen moods of syllogisms, medieval logicians came up with a short verse which ‘encoded’ the details of each of the three figures:</p>
<p>±col2±</p>
<p>Barbara Celarent Darii Ferio Baralipton</p>
<p>Celantes Dabitis Fapesmo Friesomorum</p>
<p>Cesare Cambestres Festino Barocho Darapti</p>
<p>Felapto Disamis Datisi Bocardo Ferison</p>
<p>±col3±</p>
<p>To understand how this worked let us look at our first example of the first figure:</p>
<p>‘All that is just is good. All that is virtuous is just. Therefore, all that is virtuous is good.’</p>
<p>This syllogism consists of two universal affirmative premises and a universal affirmative conclusion.</p>
<p>±row±</p>
<p>±col1±</p>
<p>This syllogism is represented by the word ‘B<b>a</b>rb<b>a</b>r<b>a</b>’, where the three vowels ‘a, a, a’ indicate that this is a syllogism made up of three universal affirmatives (represented by ‘a’, taken from
  <em>‘</em><b><em>a</em></b><em>ffirmo’). </em>In ‘C<b>e</b>l<b>a</b>r<b>e</b>nt’, on the other hand, the vowel ‘e’ represents a universal negative (‘no x is y’, taken from
  <em>‘n</em><b><em>e</em></b><em>go’</em>). A syllogism represented by ‘C<b>e</b>l<b>a</b>r<b>e</b>nt’, is made up of a universal negative, a universal affirmative, and a universal negative conclusion. For
  example: ‘No cat is a horse. Every tiger is a cat. Therefore, no tiger is a horse.’ Meanwhile, the vowels <em>i </em>and <em>o </em>represent the particular affirmative (’some x is y’) and the particular negative (‘some x is not y’) respectively
  (with <em>i </em>taken from ‘<em>affirmo’ </em>and <em>o </em>from <em>‘neg</em><b><em>o</em></b><em>’</em>).</p>
<p>±col2±</p>
<p>An influential account of the moods of the syllogisms, popularizing this verse, is found in Peter of Spain’s <em>Summulae</em>. In this manuscript, Paris, BnF, MS lat. 16611, f. 14v, given to the Sorbonne by the thirteenth-century master, Gerard
  d’Abbeville ±a±2ab±a±, the names of the syllogisms have been added in the space between the two columns of text.</p>

<h2>Playing with syllogisms I: Leiden UB, BPL 88</h2>
<p>This bifolium (ff. 1 – 2) was attached to the ninth-century portion of <strong>BPL 88 </strong>±a±m88±a<strong> </strong>as a set of flyleaves. We know it became appended to this manuscript (which contains Martianus Capella’s <em>De
    nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</em>) by<em> </em>the eleventh century at the latest, as on <strong>f. 2v </strong>an eleventh-century hand has added an ‘<strong><em>accessus</em></strong>’, a short introductory text, adding detail about
  Martianus and his writings, suggesting that by this point the bifolium and text were joined<strong>. </strong></p>

<p>On ff. 1v-2r a scribe has added a series of ‘squares of oppositions’ and syllogisms. At first glance these look as though the scribe is experimenting with the possibilities of the ‘square of opposition’, plugging in various options at random.
  However, when we look closely at the content we find that the collection of schemes is far from haphazardly arranged. All of these sets of propositions can be found in <strong>Boethius</strong>’s first commentary on his translation of
  <strong>Aristotle’s</strong> <em> De interpretatione </em>(= <em>Peri Hermeneias</em>)<em>. </em>Compare <strong>BPL 25 </strong>±a±m25±a where these sets of propositions (with the exception of the last) are found in the margins. The bifolium is,
  effectively, a diagrammatic summary of <em>De interpretatione</em>!</p>

<p>±col1±</p>
<p>The scribe has gathered all these sets of propositions into one place. Was he a student, making a medieval ‘crib sheet’, looking to memorise all the propositions from the text, and perhaps wanting to have all the schemes to hand as he worked his
  way through Boethius’s complex text? Another possibility is that this bifolium could be a draft sheet for a scribe; the fact that the second scheme on f. 1v duplicates and corrects the content of the first suggests that this sheet could represent
  ‘work in progress’. The unfinished zodiacal scheme on f. 2r might lead us to the same conclusion. Schemes were not easy to plan and draw and draft sheets must have been made, although they rarely survive.</p>

<h2>Playing with syllogisms II: Leiden UB, BPL 139 (Paris BnF lat. 6638)</h2>
<p>This manuscript contains a ‘wheel of syllogisms’, an alternate means of representing the relationship between propositions than the ’square of opposition’.</p>

<p>The wheel is found at the conclusion of a copy of Apuleius’s (c. 123 – 170) exposition on Aristotle’s <em>Peri hermenias </em>and represents a portion of Apuleius’s text: ‘It is clear that someone who has proposed something asserts to it. But
  either universal is destroyed in three ways: when its particular is shown to be false or when either of the two others – its contrary or contradictory is shown to be true. However it is established in one way: if its contradictory is shown to be
  false. On the other hand a particular proposition is destroyed in one way: if its contradictory is shown to be true. However it is established in three ways: if its universal is true or if either of the two others – its subcontrary or contradictory
  is false’. [translation from S. Gersh, <em>Concord in Discourse. Harmonics and semiotics in late classical and early medieval Platonism</em> (1996), pp. 168-9]</p>
<p>±col2±</p>
<p>Here ‘A’ represents the ‘universal affirmative’, ‘B’ the ‘universal negative’, ‘C’ the ‘particular affirmative’ and ‘D’ the ‘particular negative’. Each quadrant represents how to deal with one type of proposition : here the highlighted section in
  yellow deals with the ‘universal affirmative’ (indicated as ‘A in the central section, here in red). The text in the outer ring of the circle reads ‘<em>contra universalem affirmationem’, </em>‘against the universal affirmative’. The segments of
  the quadrant offer four possibilities: If D, the particular negative, is false the universal affirmative is true; if C, the particular affirmative, is false the universal affirmative is false; if B, the universal negative, is true, the universal
  affirmative is false; if D, the particular negative, is true, the universal affirmative is false.</p>

<p>The wheel shows that scholars experimented with different ways to represent relationships between propositions aside from the ‘square of opposition’. This manuscript was copied at Fleury (the next codicological unit contains some of the logical
  works of <strong>Abbo of Fleury </strong>±a±2ga±a). We know Abbo used schemes in his works, but how was this one used in practice? A clue can be found in another copy of the wheel, found in Paris, BnF, MS lat. 6638. This manuscript contains a
  fragment of <em>De syllogismis hypotheticis </em>of <strong>Abbo of Fleury</strong> (f. 1va-4rb), followed by Apuleius’s work. Here the scheme is added on a small piece of parchment now bound into the manuscript. Unlike the copy in Leiden, UB, BPL
  139 B, this copy could have been rotated, allowing the reader to follow the propositions around the wheel more easily. The fact that it was copied on a small sheet suggests that this might have been a study aid, a loose piece of parchment to have
  to hand while reading Apuleius’s text.</p>

<h2>Playing with syllogisms III: Leiden UB, VLF 48</h2>
<p>Here two scribes have used the blank space at the end of this manuscript of Martianus Capella’s <em>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</em> as a space for writing some notes: this shows how ‘unused’ parchment could become a venue in which material
  only tangentially related to the content of the codex was gathered.</p>

<p>The first scheme uses syllogisms to ‘prove’ the utility of dialectic. Here dialectical methods are harnessed to show that the art itself has merit, but the ‘proof’ also provides an example of dialectical argumentation in action.</p>

<p>±col1±</p>
<p>The inspiration for the text of this scheme is Martianus himself. In <em>De nuptiis</em>, IV.422, <strong>the figure of Dialectic </strong>offers the same example of a mixed syllogism to prove that dialectic is advantageous. Effectively the reader
  is working out the steps made by <em>Dialectica</em> in reaching this conclusion; we get an insight into their thought process!</p>

<h2>Playing with syllogisms IV: Leiden UB, BPL 84</h2>
<p>This segment of text from Boethius’s <em>Introductio ad syllogismos categoricos</em>, an introduction to Aristotle’s theory of syllogisms, gives an example of how one ‘converts’ a proposition. The first line reads (in translation): ‘Every man is
  rational’ converts to ‘No man is not-rational’ This is an example of ‘conversion by obversion’ (if every A is B, then no A is ‘non-B’). Conversion was a useful technique for the medieval logician as it allowed new propositions to be generated from
  existing ones. </p>

<p>Although this is quite a technical discussion, the scribe has still found an opportunity to make his reader laugh, making the initial ‘Q’ out of a man and woman making love. Her blush and guilty look at the reader gives the impression that the
  couple have been caught in the act!</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader would have also got a laugh out of this list of commonplaces, or ‘loci’, used for argumentation found in another collection of Boethian logical works. Here the list is decorated with a flourish that on closer inspection is
  clearly male genitals! These sexual details have not been defaced or erased, suggesting that the (most likely religious) reader of the texts was not without a sense of humour.</p>

<p>An elaborate scheme has been added at the end of the <em>Introductio ad syllogismos categoricos</em>, offering a summary of the characteristics of ‘simple propositions’. The scheme combines two parts of Boethius’ text; first his explanation of
  simple propositions (<em>PL,</em> 64, 769C-769D) and then some of the examples he gives later in the text of how such propositions convert.</p>
