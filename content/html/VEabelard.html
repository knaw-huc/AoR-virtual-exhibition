<p>±col1±</p><h2>Peter Abelard/ Petrus Abaelardus (c. 1079-1142)</h2><p>Peter Abelard, or Petrus Abaelardus (c. 1079-1142) stands at the threshold of the age of scholasticism and the rise of the universities. He made a name for himself as a teacher of logic, just before the bulk of Aristotle’s writings became available again in the West. His learning represents the summit of the study of the <em>logica vetus</em>. Abelard is called ‘“the greatest logician of the middle ages” [King, Arlig, 2018] and the pioneer of the scholastic method. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Abelard was born in 1079 in Le Pallet, a small town in Brittany. The details of his life are relatively well-known thanks to his autobiographical letter, the <em>Historia calamitatum: Story of My Troubles, </em>in which he recorded the formative years of his studies, when he travelled to study with well-known teachers. In the <em>Historia calamitatum </em>he presents himself as an itinerant scholar:  “I began travelling across several provinces disputing, like a true peripatetic philosopher, wherever I heard that the study of my chosen art most flourished”  (trans. Novikoff, 2014, 325). Disputations would play a vital role in Abelard’s career, both as a student and as a teacher.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[abelard.jpg]]]</p>±meta±<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abelard studied poetry, grammar, rhetoric and dialectic with Roscelin of Compíègne (d. 1125), who is often regarded as the founder of nominalism, perhaps at his school in Loches. It was here that Abelard’s fascination with dialectic as a language art was born. Roscelin represented a new type of teacher: a secular cleric who was free to move from school to school – a model that Abelard would later emulate [Mews, 2005, 21]. He went on to study dialectic with William of Champeaux (d. 1122) in Paris, at the cathedral school of Notre Dame. Abelard writes that he fell out with William, when he defeated his master in argument and forced William to modify his position on universals. Abelard set himself up as a teacher, first at Melun and then in Corbeil, near Paris. Around 1113 another period of study followed, when Abelard went to Laon to study theology with Anselm (d. 1117) who enjoyed fame as an authority on Scripture and the church fathers.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[712.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Anselm’s traditional approach, however, did not appeal to Abelard and he returned to Paris, where he became scholar-in-residence at Notre Dame. Even though Abelard fell out with all his masters, his intellectual development owed much to the teaching of Roscelin, William and Anselm and, to the disputations he had with them. He continued disputing his former masters in his logical and theological writings in which he frequently formulated his own position on an issue in opposition to theirs. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[disputing3.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>After returning from Laon, Abelard wrote the <em>Dialectica, </em>his first major treatise on dialectic, based on lectures he gave in Paris in 1115-6 [King, Arlig, 2018]. It was probably completed by 1117-18 [Mews, 2004, 56] The book is dedicated to the education of the sons of his brother Dagobert. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Abelard’s <em>Dialectic</em> posed a challenge to traditional dialectic in that it emphasized words and their meanings, rather than things <em>(res) </em>(Mews, 2004, 56)<em>.</em> Abelard’s reservations with regard to the material existence of universal things beyond the realm of discourse are regularly framed in opposition to the opinions of ‘our master W’, a barely veiled reference to his former teacher William of Champeaux.</p><p>±col3±</p><p> For Abelard, dialectic was above all an art of language. His semantic approach to dialectic was inspired by his teacher Roscelin who was one of the vocalist dialecticians who considered words (<em>voces</em>) as the building blocks of all dialectic. Another source of inspiration was the anonymous <em>Glosule </em>on Priscian’s <em>Grammatical Institutes </em>that started to circulate by the late 1070s. The <em>Glosule </em>emphasised that all words (<em>voces) </em>are in the end utterances of human imposition. These and other late eleventh- and early twelfth-century texts and teachers set the agenda for a discussion between ‘realists’ (or ‘universalists’) and ‘vocalists’ (or ‘nominalists’)<em> </em>in the schools of northern France and Normany for the next 50 years (Mews, 2004, 28)</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abelard’s <em>Dialectica </em>has survived in only one manuscript: Paris, BnF, lat. 14614 (ff. 117-202), dating to the twelfth century. The manuscript belonged to the library of St. Victor in Paris. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf146_117_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Constant Mews has argued that the hand that made corrections and annotations to the text could well be Abelard’s hand [Mews, 2004, 47 and 260]. Especially the section on <em>sententia vocis</em>, the teaching or message of a word, received relatively extensive annotations. Next to where Abelard points out that every verb signifies an action or a passion, the note on f. 130r adds the interpretation of Donatus on this issue and the note on f. 130v that of Priscian, comparing it, again, to the interpretation of Donatus</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-14614 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Logic for beginners</h2><p>It is unclear when exactly Abelard composed the <em>Introductiones parvulorum – Logic for beginners, </em>a series of glosses on the standard texts of the <em>logica vetus, </em>of Porphyry, Aristotle and Boethius. The <em>Introductiones, </em>which<em> </em>are basically a set of teaching notes, probably reflect Abelard’s teaching at an early stage of his career, before he wrote the <em>Dialectica. </em>Yet by the time the sole surviving manuscript of the <em>Introductiones parvulorum </em>was copied (Paris, BnF, lat. 13368, twelfth century) Abelard had already gained a solid reputation as a teacher. For whereas most glosses on logical texts from the period have been transmitted anonymously, these glosses identify the author [Mews, 2004, 33] </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[13368.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>An abbreviated version of this attribution occurs on f. 128r and another one on f. 156r, together with Porphyry’s name. Whether the epithet ‘supreme peripatetic’ was Abelard’s own idea or that of one of his disciples is hard to tell. The fact remains that it is remarkable that the name of a modern commentator is identified, alongside the name of ancient authority. It reflects a new attitude to the gloss as a textual genre (Mews, 1999, 71)</p><p>±col2±</p><p>In the <em>Logica ‘ingredientibus’ , </em>his next series of glosses and commentaries on Porphyry, Aristotle and Boethius, (written between 1117 and 1121)<em> </em>Abelard no longer focussed on dialectic in a strict sense but turned his attention to all language arts that underpin argumentation. In the <em>Logica ‘ingredientibus’</em> he formulated a more elaborate and profound theory of language and universals than he did in the <em>Dialectica </em>(Mews, 2004, 82) Before he had expressed reservations with regard to universals, now he flatly contested any real existence of a universal outside of discourse.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>In the <em>Logica ‘ingredientibus’ </em>Abelard mentions that he came across Aristotle’s <em>Sophistical Refutations </em>on an earlier occasion and has now carefully reread it<em>. </em>This is an early reference to a work<em> </em>that would be studied intensively only from the 1130s onwards. By the 1120s he had also encountered another text from the <em>logica nova: </em>Aristotle’s <em>Prior Analytics. </em>Yet Abelard does not seem to have studied these new Aristotelian texts in any depth, but appears to have consulted them mainly for reference. His main interest remained with the <em>logica vetus</em></p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>His contemporaries, and especially his students, appreciated Abelard for his commentaries and glosses on the curriculum of the <em>logica vetus</em>. He livened up his lectures with self-ironic examples to amuse his students and make dry logic more palpable, such as “His girl loves Peter” as the converse of “Peter loves his girl”. In the glosses that have survived in Munich, Clm 14479 he made fun of his own slight stature when illustrating different types of contradiction:  … it can apply equally to both “Peter will close this door, Peter will not close this door”; or it relates more to another, as “Peter will fall into the latrine, Peter will not fall into the latrine” relates more to falling, because he is small, even if great in forbearance. Munich, Clm 14479, f. 53v , translation Mews, 2004, 35</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Among modern scholars, Abelard is less known for his glosses on logic than for a work that he wrote around 1120, <em>Sic et non.</em> In <em>Sic et non (For and Against) </em>he placed 158 opposing arguments and seemingly conflicting statements from scriptural and patristic authorities against one another, to stimulate reflection and debate. In the preface he formulates the purpose of his collection: “by doubting we come to question, and by questioning we arrive at truth”. <em>Sic et non</em> is commonly regarded as a landmark in the history of critical thinking and an important step in development of the scholastic method of the <em>disputatio. </em>[Novikoff, Weijers, Rexroth] </p><p>±col3±</p><p>Abelard’s<em> Sic et non </em>is, however, not as innovative as would appear at first sight. The method of collecting apparently contradicting statements was widely applied among the glossators of Roman law at the end of the eleventh century [Flechner], and traces of a similar method of weighing and assessing authorities can be found in the margins and blank spaces of early medieval manuscripts</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here we see a sixteenth-century paper transcript of Abelard’s <em>Sic et non.</em> On a flyleaf a note is added, taken from the work of abbot Trithemius of Trondheim (1462-1516), who wrote an assessment of ‘Peter, the dialectician of Paris’ (Petrus dialecticus Parisiensis) In the note, Trithemius refers to the council of Sens of 1141 where the ‘depraved doctrine’ of Abelard was condemned, thanks to ‘the efforts of Saint Bernard’. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[165p1.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[165fly.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>It was, however, not for writing the <em>Sic et non </em>that Abelard was condemned but for his theological treatises. His philosophical analysis of the Trinity caused a stir among ecclesiastical authorities such as Bernardus of Clairvaux, who charged him with heresy. Abelard’s theological writings, the ensuing condemnations, and his illicit love affair with Heloise d’Argenteuil, are discussed in another section of this exhibition ±a±4se±a±. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>Abelard’s logical works sprang from lectures he gave to his students and occasionally preserve classroom debates [Novikoff 2014, 331]. He kept revising his work as he changed his view. As a result of this working method, which was in fact very similar to that of Aristotle himself (Kennedy, 1999, 75), his work has survived in different versions in often incomplete manuscripts. This is why most of his writings are hard to date and provide Abelard-scholars with a headache. At the same time, the complicated circumstances of transmission make studying Abelard all the more interesting, because the different versions, gaps, revisions, additions and corrections allow the reader to see a scholar’s mind at work. </p><p>±col3±</p><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> King, Peter and Arlig, Andrew, "Peter Abelard", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </em>(Fall 2018 Edition), Edward N.
