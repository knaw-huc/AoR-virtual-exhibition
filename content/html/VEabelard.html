<p>±col1±</p><h2>Peter Abelard, student and teacher<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></h2><p>Peter Abelard, or Petrus Abaelardus (c. 1079-1142) stands at the threshold of the age of scholasticism and the rise of the universities. He made a name for himself as a teacher of logic, just before the bulk of Aristotle’s writings became available again in the West. His learning represents the summit of the study of the <em>logica vetus</em>. Abelard is called ‘“the greatest logician of the middle ages” and the pioneer of the scholastic method. <sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>±col2±</p><p>Abelard was born in 1079 in Le Pallet, a small town in Brittany. The details of his life are well-known from autobiography, <em>The Story of My Misfortunes </em>(<em>Historia calamitatum</em>),<em> </em>in which he recorded the formative years of his studies, when he travelled to study with well-known teachers. He presents himself as an itinerant scholar: “I began travelling across several provinces disputing, like a true peripatetic philosopher, wherever I heard that the study of my chosen art most flourished.”<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Disputations would play a vital role in Abelard’s career, both as a student and as a teacher. </p><p>±col3i±</p><p>[[[abelard.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Manuscript Paris, BnF, lat. 2923, from the late thirteenth century contains a copy of Abelard’s autobiography.

It was here that Abelard’s fascination with dialectic as a language art was born. Roscelin represented a new type of teacher: a secular cleric who was free to move from school to school – a model that Abelard would later emulate.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> He went on to study dialectic with William of Champeaux (d. 1122) in Paris, at the cathedral school of Notre Dame. Abelard writes that he fell out with William, when he defeated his master in argument.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[2200f58.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abelard set himself up as a teacher, first at Melun and then in Corbeil, near Paris. Around 1113 another period of study followed. He went to Laon to study theology with Anselm (d. 1117) who enjoyed fame as an authority on Scripture and the church fathers. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[712.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Anselm’s traditional approach, however, did not appeal to Abelard and he returned to Paris, where he became scholar-in-residence at Notre Dame.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Even though Abelard fell out with all his masters, his intellectual development owed much to the teaching of Roscelin, William, Anselm and to the disputations he had with them. He continued disputing his former masters in his logical and theological writings in which he frequently formulated his own position on an issue in opposition to theirs. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[disputing3.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>After returning from Laon, Abelard wrote the <em>Dialectica, </em>his first major treatise on dialectic, based on lectures he gave in Paris in 1115-6 [King, Arlig, 2018]. It was probably completed by 1117-18 [Mews, 2005, 56] The book is dedicated to the education of the sons of his brother Dagobert.  Abelard’s <em>Dialectica </em>has survived in only one manuscript: Paris, BnF, lat. 14614 (ff. 117-202), dated to the twelfth century. The manuscript belonged to the library of St. Victor in Paris. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf146_117_r }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The opening of the <em>Dialectica </em>is missing, but an identification of the text is written at the top of the page: ‘scripta super predicamenta Aristotilis.’</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[14614f117rfr.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Constant Mews has suggested that the hand that made corrections and added notes in the margin could well be Abelard’s.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-14614 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abelard’s <em>Dialectic</em> posed a challenge to traditional dialectic in that it emphasized words and their meanings, rather than things (<em>res).</em><sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> For Abelard, dialectic was above all an art of language. His semantic approach to dialectic was inspired by his teacher Roscelin, who considered words (<em>voces</em>) as the building blocks of all dialectic. Another source of inspiration was the anonymous <em>Glosule </em>on Priscian’s <em>Grammatical Institutes </em>that started to circulate by the late 1070s. The <em>Glosule</em> and other late eleventh- and early twelfth-century texts and teachers set the agenda for a discussion between ‘realists’ and ‘vocalists’,<em> </em>in the schools of northern France and Normany for the next 50 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[glosule.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Logic for beginners</h2><p>It is unclear when exactly Abelard composed the <em>Introductiones parvulorum – Logic for beginners, </em>a series of glosses on the standard texts of the <em>logica vetus </em>of Porphyry, Aristotle and Boethius. The <em>Introductions, </em>which<em> </em>are basically a set of teaching notes, probably reflect Abelard’s teaching at an early stage of his career, before he wrote the <em>Dialectica. </em>Yet by the time the sole surviving manuscript of the <em>Introductions </em>was copied (Paris, BnF, lat. 13368) Abelard had gained a solid reputation as a teacher. For whereas most glosses on logical texts from the period have been transmitted anonymously, these glosses identify the author [Mews, 2004, 33]. Above the first column of a section on divisions, starting on folio 146 recto is written (outlined in red): “Here is the start of Peter Abelard, the younger supreme peripatetic of Le Pallet, on divisions. ” (“<em>petri abaelardi iunioris palatini summi peripatetici de divisionibus incipit”) </em></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[13368f146r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>A version of this attribution (but damaged) occurs at the start of the <em>Introductions </em>on folio 128 recto and another one on folio 156 recto, where it can be found next to Porphyry’s name. Whether the epithet ‘supreme peripatetic’ was Abelard’s own idea or that of one of his disciples is hard to tell. The fact remains that it is remarkable that the name of a modern commentator is identified, alongside the name of ancient authority. It reflects a new attitude to the gloss as a textual genre.<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-13368 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In the <em>Logica ‘ingredientibus’ , </em>his next series of glosses and commentaries on Porphyry, Aristotle and Boethius, (written between 1117 and 1121),<em> </em>Abelard mentions that he has carefully reread Aristotle’s <em>Sophistical Refutations. </em>This is an early reference to a text from the <em>logica nova </em>that would be studied intensively only from the 1130s onwards. By the 1120s Abelard had also encountered another text from the <em>logica nova: </em>Aristotle’s <em>Prior Analytics. </em>Yet Abelard does not seem to have studied these new Aristotelian texts in any depth; he consulted them mainly for reference. His main interest remained with the <em>logica vetus.</em></p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_164_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abelard’s logical works occasionally preserve classroom debates [Novikoff 2014, 331]. He livened up his lectures with self-ironic examples to amuse his students and make dry logic more palpable, such as “His girl loves Peter” as the converse of “Peter loves his girl”. In the glosses that have survived in manuscript Munich, Clm 14479 he made fun of his own slight stature when illustrating different types of contradiction: </p><p> … it can apply equally to both “Peter will close this door, Peter will not close this door”; or it relates more to another, as “Peter will fall into the latrine, Peter will not fall into the latrine” relates more to falling, because he is small, even if great in forbearance.”<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[14479f53v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abelard’s logical works were little studied after the twelfth century, as they were written shortly before the influx of newly available Aristotelian treatises, which completely changed intellectual life in the thirteenth century.  Abelard may have been the greatest and surely the most talked-about logician of the twelfth century, who was always in the centre of disputations and controversies, but soon his work was no longer relevant for contemporary debates.<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p><p>±col2±</p><p>This section of the exhibition dealt with Abelard’s logical works.
