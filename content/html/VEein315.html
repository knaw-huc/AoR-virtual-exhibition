<p>±col1±</p><h2>Binding:</h2><p><strong>Einsiedeln, Stiftsbibliothek Cod. 315 (605) </strong>is a tenth-century manuscript, now encased in a fourteenth-century tooled alum taw binding. Faint traces of the volume’s title can still be seen on the cover.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-eincover }}±meta± ±timeline± ±map± <p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Contents:</h2><p>The manuscript contains a copy of Boethius’s second commentary on the <em>Isagoge </em>of Porphyry. The title of this five-book text, ‘<em>liber Boetii in isagoges porphyrii’</em>,was written on this page by the fourteenth-century librarian of Einsieldeln, Heinrich von Ligerz. He also added the extended pointing finger (<em>manicula</em>) pointing to the title. It is possible that the manuscript was bound in a limp, soft, cover prior to being backed with hard boards in the fourteenth century. Leaving the first page of the manuscript blank (and starting the text on its verso) reduced the chance that text would be lost if the outer binding was damaged.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_1_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Scribal collaboration: </h2><p>The manuscript was copied by multiple scribes. Here we can see two pages where the scribe switches half-way through the page. The fact that multiple scribes worked together on this manuscript suggests a need for efficiency – the exemplar from which this was made may have been on loan for a limited time from another monastery or passing scholar. Speed trumps aesthetics; these scribes picked up after each other in the middle of a line, even when their writing styles were quite distinctive.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein_12_66 }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Traces of readership: </h2><p>The manuscript does not have many annotations, but still holds evidence of reader practices.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_6_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>While the preceding set of corrections and markups suggested that the text was prepared for attentive reading, the marginal activity here suggests otherwiseA half-finished doodle of a bearded face brings a (bored?) later reader to life. Meanwhile, we also find some traces of a scribe testing their quill, writing out the first letters of the alphabet (‘a, b, d, e, f, g’) as well as drawing a majuscule initial ’C’, perhaps trying to emulate the style of the initial ‘S’ on this page.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_164_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Here a small slip of parchment has been added to the manuscript. Slips like this were sometimes used to supply extra or missing information. If we look at a detail of the other side of the scrap (p. 52a), we can see that the pores of the animal used to make the parchment are very visible. It is possible that this parchment was deemed unfit for inclusion in a manuscript, and so was cut up to be recycled in other ways, such as for slips.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein_52_a_b }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>The slip has been used to provide a set of definitions from the famous encyclopedia, the <em>Etymologiae</em>, of Isidore of Seville.The section, taken from <em>Etymologiae </em>II.24.3, identifies three kinds, or ’<em>species</em>’, of philosophy: natural, moral, and rational. The rational type is, according to Isidore, called <em>‘loica</em>’, logic, by the Greeks. Isidore defines logic as occupied with the investigation of the truth,  whether regarding disputations over the causes of things or in moral matters. This slip places the study of logic within the greater context of philosophy. Along with the study of physics (nature) and ethics (morality), the study of logic is a key component of philosophy.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_52_b }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>The ‘Porphyrian tree’</h2><p>The slip (p. 52b) is found adjacent to this page, where Boethius discusses Porphyry’s definition of a species by genus and difference <strong>(link to detailed discussion of the tree)</strong>. It’s possible that the scribe was prompted to add the slip by Isidore’s reference to the ‘species’ of philosophy, that is, how the genus of philosophy could be further broken down into constituent components. This ‘tree’, which is one of the earliest visualisations of Porphyry’s ideas in this form, concludes with the species ‘man’, ‘<em>homo</em>’. Here the classical philosophers Socrates, Cicero, and Plato, are listed as examples of the species ‘man’.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein315_53_ }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Visual representations of logic: </h2><p>This part of Boethius’ commentary (Book V, 12) deals with Porphyry’s discussion of the number of feasible ways in which the five predicables – genus, species, property, difference, accident – could be combined. Here each predicable is assigned a letter, a-e. As the illustration shows, a can be combined with b, c, d, and e; b can be combined with a, c, d, e etc. However, pairings repeat: it is possible to make four individual pairings between a and the other letters. But b can only be combined into three new individual pairings, c into two new individual pairings, and so on. Ultimately, therefore, 10 individual pairings can be made between the five predicables (4+3+2+1= 10). </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-ein_139_bpl }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Decorating the text</h2><p>The blank space at the top of this page was probably intended to accommodate a rubric introducing the textual division.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-decorating }}
