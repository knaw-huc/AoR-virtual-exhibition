<p>±col1±</p><h2>Peter Abelard/ Petrus Abaelardus (c. 1079-1142)</h2><p>Peter Abelard was a scholastic philosopher. He studied with Roscelin and later with William of Champeaux in Paris, at the cathedral school of Notre Dame. Abelard writes in his autobiographal letter <em>The Story of My Troubles (Historia calamitatum) </em>that he fell out with his master, because he defeated William in argument. Abelard set up a school of his own in Corbeil, near Paris. A third period of study followed, when Abelard decided to study theology with Anselmus of Laon. From the mid-1130’s he taught in the schools on the Mont Ste.-Genevieve in Paris. Among Abelard’s students were three popes, several heads of state and, notably, Heloise d’Argentueil, with whom he corresponded until the end of his life (see women and disputation ±a±4wd±a±)</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[abelard.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abelard is called “the greatest logician of the middle ages”<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Among his early works on logic is the <em>Dialectica. </em>It was written before 1117 and based on lectures he gave in Paris in 1115-6.

In the margins of early medieval manuscripts, centuries before Abelard, annotators weighed and assessed statements of authorities, so they could be used to construct a logical and persuasive argument. Unfortunately there is not a single digitized medieval manuscript of Abelard’s <em>Sic et non </em>to show in this exhibition. We can, however,  show a sixteenth-century paper transcript: Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 165.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[165p1.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>On a flyleaf a note taken from the work of Trithemius (1462-1516), with his assessment of ‘Peter, the dialectician of Paris’ Trithemius refers to the council of Sens of 1141 where the ‘depraved doctrine’ of Abelard was condemned, thanks to ‘the agency of Saint Bernard’.
