<h2>Minor Latin Rhetoricians<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> </h2><table><tr><td></td></tr></table><p>Together with Cicero’s <a href="file:///C:\text-portraits.html?portait=Cicero"><em>De inventione</em></a> and the <a href="file:///C:\text-portraits.html?portait=Herennium"><em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em></a> there were a number of late Antique texts, composed by the so-called “minor Latin rhetoricians”. This body of texts constituted the school books for the study of rhetoric during the Middle Ages. They show the continuity of classical Greek and Roman rhetoric, how it flourished in the Later Roman Empire and became a core discipline taught in schools in the Middle Ages. These texts provided a synthesis and adaptation of the earlier sources, which were more elaborate and more complex to grasp, and thus met the practical concerns of medieval teaching. They all conformed to the rhetorical tradition of Cicero and Quintilian, but also showed Greek influence. </p><p>In the first century CE, Rutilius Lupus wrote the treatise <em>De Figuris Sententiarum et Elocutionis</em>. The text deals with the topic of elocution and figures of speech (anaphora, metaphor, oxymoron etc.). It consists of two books divided into 41 sections, each devoted to one of the figures, which are given a Latin spelling, a short definition, and an example, usually from a Greek orator. </p><p>[[[MLR.jpg]]]</p><p>Another treatise on figures of speech that adapted a Greek rhetorical work was written in the third century by Aquila Romanus (<em>De Figuris Sententiarum et Elocutionis</em>). Around a century later the rhetorician Julius Rufinianus added more figures (almost doubling their number). Two other short treatises written on the same subject, <em>De Schematis Lexeos Liber</em> and <em>De Schematis Dianoeas</em>.</p><p><br />In the fourth century, Consultus Fortunatianus wrote his <em>Ars rhetorica</em>. It is a handbook in the form of questions and answers, meant for memorisation. For instance, the first question is “what is rhetoric?”, and the answer is: “The science of speaking well”. He discussed all five parts of rhetoric, but treated the part called “invention” in greater detail in the first two books. Other parts, such as arrangement, style, memory and delivery, were treated in the third book. Cicero’s orations are often cited as examples.<br />Marius Victorinus was a renowned fourth-century rhetorician and Neoplatonic philosopher active in Rome. He wrote a commentary on Cicero’s <em>De inventione</em>. The commentary incorporates many paraphrases in order to enable the students to understand the text better, and focuses on syllogism, the relation between rhetoric and logic and the terminology of <em>De inventione</em>.</p><p></p><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> Contribution by Katia Riccardo.<br />Cite as, Katia Riccardo, ±cite± <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li></ol>
