<p>±col1±</p><h2>Women &amp; disputation</h2><p>According to the Apostle Paul, women were not allowed to teach men. Yet they <em>were</em> allowed to ask questions, and occasionally provide answers. The apostolic restriction on teaching limited women’s access to the art of reasoning. We rarely hear of a woman involved in disputation. But sometimes we do. Here are four portraits of women who engaged in disputation, from late Antiquity to the high middle ages. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[disputing.jpg]]]</p>±meta±<p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Marcella of Rome (325-410) </h2><p>Marcella was a wealthy aristocratic woman from a Christian family. She founded a community of women and supported the scholarly work of Jerome. Her knowledge of the scriptures was well-known and people turned to Marcella to ask her questions and discuss interpretations of scripture.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>During the Origenist controversy she publicly opposed those who supported the teachings of Origen. According to Jerome, Marcella played such a vital role in the debate that to his mind the success of the condemnation of Origenist. Doctrines should be attributed to her efforts.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[marcella.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>After Marcella’s death. Jerome writes to her student Principia: “….she never came to see me that she did not ask me some question concerning [scriptures], nor would she at once acquiesce in my explanations but on the contrary would dispute them; not, however, for argument’s sake but to learn the answers to those objections which might, as she saw, be made to my statements.”</p><p>±col2±</p><p>“….after my departure from Rome, in case of a dispute arising  as to the testimony of scripture on any subject, recourse was had to her to settle it. And so wise was she and so well did she understand what philosophers call τό πρέπον, that is, the becoming, in what she did, that when she answered questions she gave her own opinion not as her own but as from me or some one else, thus admitting that what she taught she had herself learned from others. For she knew that the apostle had said: “I suffer not a woman to teach” and she would not seem to inflict a wrong upon the male sex many of whom (including sometimes priests) questioned her concerning obscure and doubtful points.” Jerome, Letter 127</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[Jerome.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Eulalia of Mérida, as represented by Prudentius (d. after 405)</h2><p>Prudentius devoted the third book in his ‘Crowns of martyrdom’ to Eulalia of Mérida, who died a martyr in 305. According to Prudentius, Eulalia challenged Roman magistrates during her trial with provocative questions. When they tried to persuade her to change her position,  Eulalia spat in the eyes of her interrogator, abused the governor and destroyed the symbols of his pagan religion.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Prudentius does not portray Eulalia as participating in a rational, dialectical disputation, but she surely ‘talks back’ when questioned. As is the case with many martyrdom narratives, the historical veracity of the events at Eulalia’s trial is dubious. But what is important here is that Prudentius can imagine a woman arguing with a Roman official.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[Eulalia.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Eulalia’s strategies of persuasion</h2><p>Posthumously, Eulalia played a pivotal role in the disputation between the Nicene bishop Masona of Mérida (d. 610) and his Arian rival Sunna, bishop of the same city. The issue of the disputation: who could lay a claim to the church of Eulalia – the church that housed the martyr’s relics – the Nicene or Arian party? The disputation was held in the atrium of the church, before ‘all the people’ and in the presence of judges,nominated by the Arian king of the Visigoths, Leovigild.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[crypt.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>According to Paul of Mérida’s <em>Lives of the Fathers of Mérida </em>(s.7), Masona wins the debate, thanks to his superior eloquence and debating skills. He wins the church of St. Eulalia (representing Eulalia herself), but he is sent into exile by the Arian king of the Visigoths, Leovigild.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>One night, saint Eulalia appears to Leovigild in a dream. Paul presents Eulalia in a militant manner, much as Prudentius had in his <em>Crowns of Martyrdom</em>. There, Eulalia appeared as a formidable martyr, who stood no nonsense from a tyrant and spit in the eyes of her interrogator. In Paul’s narrative, Eulalia is no meek lady either. She physically assaults the king and demands that Masona be reinstated in Mérida. Leovigild, who fears further beatings from the saint, releases Masona from exile.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Eulalia’s popularity spread from Spain to Gaul. The poet Venantius Fortunatus (c. 530 -610) wrote a poem about her and the oldest extant French vernacular poem is dedicated to Eulalia. The verses are written in the langue d’oil, the vernacular language of the northern half of medieval France</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[150f141v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Gundrada, nicknamed Eulalia (fl. 800)</h2><p>Gundrada was a lady at the court of Charlemagne. She was Charlemagne’s cousin and the sister of the counsellors Adalhard and Wala, abbots of Corbie. It has been suggested that Gundrada taught at the court in some capacity (Scheck, 2008)</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Alcuin writes Gundrada a letter with instructions on how to conduct a disputation with a heretic. He sends the letter shortly after his public disputation with the Spanish adoptionist Felix In Aachen in 799. Alcuin addresses Gundrada with her nickname or pseudonym: Eulalia, ‘of noble speech’. In the literary circle of Charlemagne’s entourage pseudonyms were chosen (or given) from a resemblance with a person from Antiquity. Presumably Gundrada reminded Alcuin of Eulalia, the outspoken martyr of Mérida </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[court.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Alcuin to the lady Gundrada/ Eulalia, On how to defeat an adoptionist in a debate with the ‘weapons of dialectic’</p><p>Alcuin praises Gundrada for her skills in dialectical subtleties and offers to teach her the method of dialectical enquiry <em>(disciplina interrogationes dialecticae</em>). This method, Alcuin assures her, is particularly helpful in refuting the viewpoints of those who adhere to the heresy of Adoptionism.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>“One should ask whether every man that exists of a body and soul is a proper son of his father. If he says: yes, a proper son, then one should ask whether the soul proceeds from the father just like the flesh. If he says: no, then one should draw the inference: how is a man the proper son of his father if his soul does not proceed from the father, like the flesh” </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[reims.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Heloise d’Argenteuil (1096?-1164), abbess of the Paraclete </h2><p>Heloise is mostly known for her correspondence  and love affair with Abelard, but she was also a scholar in her own right Abelard writes about her: “She stood out above all by reason of her abundant knowledge of letters.” He continues by saying ‘this virtue is rare among women”</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Somewhere before 1278, the cleric Jeun de Meun disovered the letters of Abelard and Heloise and translated them into French. He included summaries of the letters into his continuation of Guillaume de Lorris’ <em>Roman de la Rose</em>.

Eulalia’s formidable character is only known through narratives and poems, while Heloise’s work is transmitted as an attachment to Abelard’s and is often attributed to him. Did these four women really dispute with men, or was it just part of the imagination of their biographers and correspondents?</p><p>±col2±</p><p>It’s hard to say for certain. And yet, imagination is not irrelavant. Authors such as Venantius Fortunatus and Paul the Deacon of Mérida had no trouble imagining Eulalia as a militant woman standing up to authorities and giving them a piece of her mind. Alcuin, for his part, envisioned Gundrada entering into a debate with a heretic and apparently did not consider this inappropriate conduct for a lady at court. The miniaturist of Chantilly, Musée Condé 482 pictured abbess Heliose disputing with Abelard.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>Perhaps images (verbal or pictorial) of female personifications of virtues and vices, battling for the human soul, or Lady Dialectica as a woman who was not to be trifled with induced poets and authors to at least <em>entertain </em>the possibility of women engaging in disputation, amongst themselves, but also with men. This opened possibilities for women, in spite of the apostle Paul’s restrictions with regard to teaching and public speaking. </p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>[[[prudentius.jpg]]]</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Another female personification relevant in this respect is Lady Grammar who is usually represented as a teacher in iconography </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[7900A127v.jpg]]]</p><p> </p>
