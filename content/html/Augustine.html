<h2>(Pseudo-)Augustine’s <em>De Dialectica</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></h2>

<p>The Latin text <em>De Dialectica</em> has been regarded as a work of Latin Church Father and Bishop of Hippo Augustine since at least the ninth century, but neither the manuscript tradition nor the tradition of the printed editions agree
  completely on this attribution. It is probably and adaptation of a Greek treatise that is now lost. It was Alcuin who attributed the text to Augustine. During the Carolingian time it was used as a textbook to teach dialectics. <em>De
    Dialectica</em> is a short scientific treatise on dialectic that remained unfinished. It serves as a brief account of the art of rhetoric in ten chapters. It gives a definition of dialectic as the science of “disputing well” (<em>bene disputandi
    scientia</em>) and it presents a discussion of a number of topics related to language. In particular, it is recognised that “we always dispute with words” (<em>disputamus autem utique verbis</em>). Words are then divided into two categories,
  simple words (<em>simplicia</em>) and combined words (<em>coniuncta</em>). Simple words are those which signify one thing, e.g. “homo ambulat” (“a man walks”). For combined words, the treatise gives the example “homo festinans in montem ambulat”
  (“a man walks in haste to a mountain”. Thus the statement is complicated in meaning by adding words to the simple structure of subject and verb. The text had a widespread circulation throughout the Middle Ages, both in monastic and cathedral
  schools and later in universities. It was an important text for the study of logic at the Faculty of Arts.</p>
