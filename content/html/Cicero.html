<h2>Cicero’s <em>De inventione</em> and <em>Topica<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="footnote-ref-0">[1]</a></sup></sup></em></h2><table><tr><td></td></tr></table><p>Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, was one of the most influential figures in the Republican Roman politics. Almost immediately after his death, his extensive writings were canonised as classic models of rhetoric and philosophy. They were widely read and studied in the Middle Ages and beyond. </p><p>[[[cicerohague.jpg]]]</p><p>Cicero wrote <em>De Inventione </em>(On invention), a work on rhetoric, when he was a young student. He completed two books, which deal with “invention”: the discovery of (seemingly) valid arguments. The goal was to write a complete treatise on rhetoric, where the sections of arrangement, expression or style, memory and delivery would have followed invention. If he ever indeed completed such a work, it did not survive to our time. The large amount of manuscripts that survived of <em>De inventione </em>show that it was one of the most authoritative works for the western rhetorical tradition up to the Renaissance. </p><p>Similarly, the <em>Topica</em>, together with Boethius’ commentary [link Boethius2], became a fundamental text for teaching rhetoric in schools and universities, and important for the development of scholasticism. The <em>Topica</em>, composed in 44 BCE, is an adaptation of the <em>Topics</em> of Aristotle, and illustrates how rhetorical invention should be conducted. The work was intended to be a textbook for practicing orators, such as lawyers and philosophers. Cicero’s aim was to articulate and simplify the contents of Aristotles’ <em>Topics</em>, whose technical language was difficult to grasp. </p><p><a id="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a></p><ol><li id="footnote-0"><p> Contribution by Katia Riccardo.<br />Cite as, Katia Riccardo, ±cite± <a href="#footnote-ref-0">↑</a></p></li></ol>
