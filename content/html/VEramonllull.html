<p>±col1±</p><p>Ramon Lull (c.1232-1315) was a teacher, a theologian and a philosopher, and most of all an avid debater. In one unique manuscript, his life and times come to life with extraordinary vividness: it opens as a picturebook of his life, full of detail and character. The book has the title <em>Breviculum ex artibus Raimundi Lulli electum (</em>A short selection from the Works of Ramon Llull).<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It was made after 1321, probably in Northern France. Twelve full-page miniatures paint the story of his life and teachings, or at least as they were imagined by the fourteenth-century artist.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[karlsruhef4r.jpg]]]</p>±meta± ±timeline± ±map± <p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Ramon Llull was born in Majorca, which was then Christian, but had been in Muslim hands for three centuries before. The island housed communities of Muslims, Jew and Christians. This shaped Ramon Llull and his works. In his twenties, Ramon worked as a tutor for James II of Aragon and lived a secular life. At the age of 30, however, he had a vision that made him change his life. He left his wife and children and set out on a pilgrimage to Rocamadour in the Dordogne, and Santiago of Compostella in Spain. Afterwards he returned to Majorca to study Arabic, and was deeply involved in the interreligious debates between Christians, Muslims and Jews. Several times he traveled to Spain and North Africa to convert Muslims and Jews, using reasoning and argumentation as his weapons.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[ramonf1v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>For nine years Ramon studied philosophy and theology in both Latin and Arabic. His familiarity with Arabic logical works by Al-Ghazzali and other Arab philosophers deeply influenced his own philosophy and theology. Theology was, for him, a science, for which mathematical deduction was the ideal method of reasoning. His best known work is his <em>Ars generalis ultima</em> or <em>Ars magna</em> ("The Ultimate General Art" or "The Great Art", published in 1305). In this work, logic and reasoning are used to convince Muslims of the truth of Christian faith. The whole art is deeply analytical, using visual aids and charts to combine ideas, test their soundness and to generate new conclusions.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[ramonf20v.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[ramonf3v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Fol. 5r: Ramon Llull teaching his art. On the left are nine wise men asking the ‘questiones’ that are closely linked to the Aristotelian categories: utrum, quid, de quo, quare, etcetera [link to O’Daly, Diagrams II]. These questions lead to answers that can be categorized according to the labels in the ladder: categories of being ranging from ‘deus’ to ‘homo’ and ‘vegetativa elementativa’.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>[[[ramonf5r.jpg]]]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[ramonf5rfr.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Ramon Llull’s rhetoric is one of battle and war.

From these statement, all derivative statements can be calculated,  as possible ways of finding further truths. The result is a kind of logical machine, that guides the user from on statement of truth to a host of other possible ones. The connections are visualised in schemes with lines going from node to node in networks of nodes, resulting in quite complicated geometrical shapes. Using a wheel to explore combinations was not new [link to O’Daly, Diagrams II, slide 13-20], but Ramon Llull developed them to a new extreme, which inspired generations of new logical thinkers.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[ramonf28v.jpg]]]</p><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> <a href="https://digital.blb-karlsruhe.de/blbhs/content/titleinfo/98159">https://digital.blb-karlsruhe.de/blbhs/content/titleinfo/98159 </a>J.N.
