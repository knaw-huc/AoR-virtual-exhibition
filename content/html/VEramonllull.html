<p>±col1±</p><p>Ramon Lull (c.1232-1315) was a theologian and philosopher, and most of all an avid debater. He is one of the teachers from the thirteenth century who comes most to life, because of the rare circumstance of a single manuscript that survived to our times: it opens as a picturebook of his life, full of detail and character, a unique and vivid document of Ramon’s character, life and times. The book has the title <em>Breviculum ex artibus Raimundi Lulli electum (</em>A short selection from the Works of Ramon Llull). It was made after 1321, probably in Northern France. Twelve extraordinary full-page miniatures representing his life and teachings, or at least as they were imagined by the fourteenth-century artist.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[ramonf3v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Ramon Llull was born in Majorca, which was only a few years before his birth reconquered from Muslim leadership by James I of Aragon. Three centuries, Majorca had been in Muslim hands. The island housed communities of Muslims, Jew and Christians, and this had a major influence on Ramon Lull and his works. In his twenties, Ramon worked as a tutor for James II of Aragon and lived a secular life. At the age of 30, however, he had a vision that made him change his life. He left his wife and children and set out on a pilgrimage to Rocamadour in the Dordogne, and St. James of Compostella. Afterwards he returned to Majorca to study Arabic, and was deeply involved in the interreligious debates between Christians, Muslims and Jews. Several times he traveled to Spain and North Africa to convert Muslims and Jews, using reasoning and argumentation as his weapons.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[ramonf1v.jpg]]]</p><p>For nine years Ramon studied philosophy and theology in both Latin and Arabic. His familiarity with Arabic logical works by Al-Ghazzali and other Arab philosophers deeply influenced his own philosophy and theology. Theology was, for him, a science, for which mathematical deduction was the ideal method of reasoning. His best known work is his <em>Ars generalis ultima</em> or <em>Ars magna</em> ("The Ultimate General Art" or "The Great Art", published in 1305). In this work, logic and reasoning are used to convince Muslims of the truth of Christian faith. The whole art is deeply analytical, using visual aids and charts to combine ideas, test their soundness and to generate new conclusions.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[ramonf20v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Fol. 5r: Ramon Llull teaching his art.

He worked as a tutor for James II of Aragon and although he was married and had two children he lived a “dissolute” life. One night, while he was writing a (vulgar) poem to a woman, he had a vision of Jesus hanging on the cross. Ramon realised, as he recalls in his Vita Coaetanea, that God wanted him to abandon his wife and children to fully commit his life to serve Christ.</p>{{> folios/folio-kar92_1_v }}<p>Ramon sold his possessions, undertook several pilgrimages and became a member of the Friars Minor. He believed that God wanted him to compose the “best book in the world against errors of the infidels” and convert Muslims and Jews to Christianity. When he was back in Majorca he bought a Muslim slave to teach him the Arabic language. For nine years Ramon studied philosophy and theology in both Latin and Arabic. </p>{{> folios/folio-kar92_3_v }}<p>Meet Breviculum ex artibus Raimundi Lulli electum - St. Peter perg. 92</p>{{> folios/folio-kar92_cover_ }}<p>This manuscript contains several miniatures that depict the life of Ramon Llull like a comic book</p>{{> folios/folio-kar92_10_r }}<p>F.7r shows  symbolic Llull commanding an army of knights with reinforcements to repel the enemy and tear down the Tower of Falsehood and Ignorance.

In this book Ramon tried to convert people to Christianity by using logic, reason and dialectics. The reader was encouraged to use diagrams, schemes and other visual aids to answer theological questions. “It was the earliest attempt in the history of formal logic to employ geometrical diagrams for the purpose of discovering nonmathematical truths, and the first attempt to use a mechanical device a kind of primitive logic machine to facilitate the operation of a logic system. “(Gardner 1)</p><p>[[[lampje.jpg]]]</p><p>Vanaf hier klad (hulp Irene O’D nodig)</p><p>“Llull's systems of organizing concepts using devices such as trees, ladders, and wheels, have been analyzed as classification systems.”</p>
