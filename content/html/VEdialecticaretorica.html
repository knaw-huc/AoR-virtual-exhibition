<p>±col1±</p><p>After a pupil had learnt how to read and write in Latin (<em>grammatica</em>), it was time for a next level of knowledge of the language: learning how to speak well and effectively (<em>rhetorica</em>) and how to build arguments and <em>reason</em> well (<em>dialectica</em>). These skills were needed for many purposes: to speak well is an art needed to get your message across and to convince people, to be able to argue is important for a proper understanding of texts, for using them in debates and for deciding in cases of disagreement. <em>Dialectica </em>became a crucial element in theological debate (see also ±a±4ho±a±). It also became a key element of the university curriculum: every student was thoroughly trained in the skill of dialectical reasoning with the <em>disputatio</em>, a formal game of two opponents reasoning against each other.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[karlsruhef11v.jpg]]]</p>±meta± ±timeline± ±map± <p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>The art of arguing: dialectical disputation</h2><p>The <em>disputatio</em> was an important instrument at the medieval university, as a teaching exercise but also as the most important exam: a formal public disputation was the final step to become a <em>magister</em> at the university. Today we still have a remnant of the medieval practice in many universities all over the world: a public defense of one’s thesis. The oral events were at times recorded in writing. The <em>disputatio </em>also became a literary genre, not necessarily preceded by an actual oral dipute.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Step 1: A <em>magister </em>at the university decided on a question and allocated the roles of <em>respondens</em> (respondent) and <em>opponens</em> (opponent, or, generally, opponents). In an initial session the <em>magister </em>introduced the question as a dialectical question to be answered by yes or no. <br />Step 2: The <em>respondens</em> chose one of these answers, and gave arguments for his position. The <em>opponens</em> (or <em>opponentes</em>) attacked his arguments and his position with counter-arguments.<br />Step 3: The <em>respondens</em> was given the space to respond to the counter-arguments, and give new arguments against the counter-arguments and for his initial position.<br />Step 4: The <em>magister</em> decided who has won the debate, and gives his final solution (<em>solutio</em>) to the question.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[karlsruhef8r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>The game of arguing</h2><p>To train the skill of disputing, several exercises were incorporated in the university curriculum. <em>Obligationes</em> (from the term <em>obligatio</em>, obligation or liability) were debates in which one binded oneself to uphold or deny a certain initial statement, after which one was then compelled to also uphold or deny everything that logically followed from that initial statement. It was a game of logical trickery, each party trying to trick the other in admitting to something impossible. Another exercise was the <em>quodlibet</em>, a special kind of disputation about a question on any topic and raised by anyone. The challenge was to be quick on one’s intellectual feet and show the ability to respond to questions of every nature and about any subject.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[15350f1r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Rhetorica</p><p>Cicero’s <em>De Inventione </em>and the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium </em>(unknown author but generally attributed to Cicero) ±a±m22±a± were key texts for the study of rhetoric during the entire Middle Ages. Other late-antique texts that were used in the medieval study of rhetoric were the so-called ‘minor Latin rhetoricians’ such as Rutilius Lupus, Iulius Rufinianus, Fortunatianus and Marius Victorinus. Quintilian’s major rhetorical handbook, <em>The Institutes of Oratory</em>, circulated only in incomplete manuscripts. References to it from before the 11<sup>th</sup> century are rare. In encyclopedias such as Isidore of Seville’s <em>Etymologies</em> rhetorical precepts were discussed. Figures of speech were treated within the discipline of grammar.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[herennium.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In the ninth century a new work entered the rhetorical curriculum: Alcuin’s <em>Disputatio de rhetorica</em> [link Alcuin in Teachers]. In the eleventh and twelfth century a range of new rhetorical commentaries and treatises on the <em>ars dictaminis</em> (the art of composing letters) became a firm part of rhetoric. In rhetorical manuals the discipline was further divided up into specific, practical branches: the <em>ars poetica</em>, <em>ars praedicandi</em>, <em>ars notariae</em>, etcetera. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>In the thirteenth century, together with the influx of Aristotelian logical texts, Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric</em> was reintroduced in the Latin West, in a Latin translation of Herman the German (Hermannus Allemannus). This had an enormous influence on the development of the art of rhetoric: in constructing a general theory of persuasion, Aristotle firmly connects rhetoric to the arts of dialectic and logic. The philosophical approach was avidly picked up in the later Middle Ages.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[lyon.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Dialectica and Logica</h2><p>In some definitions, the art of dialectic and the art of logic were presented as separate, in some they were synonymous. One could make the distinction that Dialectic is the art of making a good argument, Logic of adhering to the rules of sound reasoning. The two were always closely linked to each other:  in order to make a convincing argument, it had to make sense. For this reason these two arts were often treated in the same volume or text, or even as one and the same art. Logic, however, had its own set of curricular texts. The body of logical texts known and studied in the earlier Middle Ages is known as the <em>Logica Vetus</em>. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries new texts were added, known as the <em>Logica Nova</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[188f10r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Logica Vetus</h2><p><em>Logica Vetus </em>(Old Logic) is the set of logical works that were in available in the libraries and book collections of medieval Europe from the start. Several works of Aristotle are at the heart of this set. The term distinguishes these works from those of the so-called Logica Nova, the new translations of Aristotle’s remaining logical treatises that came to the Latin West in the twelfth century.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Many of the treatises of the <em>Logica Vetus </em>were made available by Boethius [text portraits], who, in the late fifth/early sixth century made it his project to translate from Greek to Latin all the works of Plato and Aristotle and to provide commentaries on them. We have his translation of Aristotle's <em>Categories</em> and <em>On Interpretation </em>[text portraits], and Porphyry’s  <em>Isagoge </em>[text portraits]. He also composed supplementary works, such as the <em>Book of Six Principles</em> and works about syllogisms (see also ±a±3sy±a±), a crucial tool for logical reasoning.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>The texts of <em>Logica Vetus</em> played a major role in the formation of the discipline of dialectic and logic.

On either side of Dialectic’s feet, two more philosophers are shown: Socrates (Plato’s teacher) on the left and ‘Magister Adam’ on the right.

Boethius had already translated many of the logical works of Aristotle, but not his <em>Prior</em> and <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, the <em>Topica</em> and <em>Sophistici elenchi</em> [text portraits]<em>.</em> With these new texts and commentaries and a new emphasis on Aristotle’s texts in the medieval university curriculum, fresh translations and commentaries flourished: William of Moerbeke, Thomas Aquinas, Robert Kilwardby and many other known and unknown medieval authors produced new commentaries. In the first decades of the 13th century, Aristotle’s works soon became the foundation of teaching in the Arts Faculties of medieval Europe. Logic became a fundamental subject, central to the programme. Handbooks with collections of logical texts set out in a certain format testify to this.</p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf178_69_r }}<ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> Teeuwen, Vocabulary of Intellectual Life, check pages. <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p> Teeuwen, Vocabulary of Intellectual Life, lemma “dialectica, logica” <a href="#footnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li></ol>
