<p><strong>Gerard D’Abbeville (1220-1272)</strong></p><p>Gerard D’Abbeville was a secular master of theology at the University of Paris and a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure.</p><p>[[[paris.jpg]]]</p><p>Abbeville wrote many Quodlibeta (topics for or exercises in philosophical or theological discussion). Eighteen of them have survived, a record!</p><p>[[[confused.jpg]]]</p><p>In the third quarter of the 13<sup>th</sup> century there arose a conflict at the University of Paris. Secular clerics opposed the teachers from Franciscan and Dominican mendicant orders. They quarreled about practical topics such as the right to occupy chairs in theology and theological questions such as the role of poverty within Christianity. Both sides –Aquinas and Bonaventure being on the side of the mendicants- published quodlibeta to underline their points. It was Abbeville who rekindled the fire of the debates in 1269 by attacking the mendicant order in a sermon and a quodlibet during Lent. </p><p>[[[protest.jpg]]]</p><p><strong>Library of Sorbonne</strong></p><p>After his death in 1272 Abbeville left the library of Sorbonne in Paris around 300 manuscripts.</p><p>[[[sorbonne.jpg]]]</p><p>Partly due to Gerard’s donation, the Sorbonne library had one of the largest collections of books in the thirteenth century. Gerard conducted that the books should also be available for scholars who were not members of the Sorbonne library. The library became an important center for theological study in the thirteenth century and was frequently used by the secular masters and scholars of the Faculty of Theology.</p><p>[[[books.jpg]]]</p><p>Did you know that Ramon Llull ±a±2rl±a± was also a frequent user of the library of Sorbonne? In 1311 he donated the library a copy of his works and requested that it would be chained to the bookcase; a common but not so subtle way of preventing books from being stolen.</p><p>[[[chainedbook.jpg]]]</p><p><strong>Let’s take a closer look at some of the books donated by Gerard d’Abbeville</strong></p><p>Meet BnF lat. 16598</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf165_cover_ }}<p>±p±5±p±</p><p>Meet BnF. lat. 16611</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf166_cover_ }}{{> folios/folio-bnf166_7_v }}{{> folios/folio-bnf166_8_v }}<p>±p±6±p±</p><p>Meer informatie van Irene O’D</p>
