<p>Teachers and students</p><p>Students were not only taught by the books they read; they needed teachers who introduced them into the subjects that they were learning, to drill them into the right way of reading and interpreting texts. That this drilling was not soft-handed, is clear from many testimonies and even images depicting the master as someone with a whip in his hand, ready to punish students for underperforming. In this section, we will look at some centres of learning and some outstanding teachers, to get an image of the role of the teacher through the ages when it comes to the art of reasoning.</p>
