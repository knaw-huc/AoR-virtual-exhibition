<p>±col1span±</p><h2>A book of models for writing letters<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </h2><p>This late thirteenth-century manuscript<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> provides a number of examples of epistolary composition, such as the letters exchanged between Abelard (1079- 1142) and Heloise (d. 1164), the letters of the Roman statesman Cassiodorus (c. 485 – c. 585) and those of magister Stephen of Tournai (1128-1203). The manuscript was in the possession of the scholar and poet Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374), who added notes to the letters and used the flyleaves at the end of the codex as a diary.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[2923cover.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>A sixteenth-century hand wrote a table of contents of on a flyleaf (Iv), listing some but not all of the letters in this codex. Highlighted are the letters of Abelard (here called ‘brother Abelard’. The name of his correspondent, Heloise, whose letters make up half of the collection, is not mentioned), a letter of Abelard’s staunch defender Berengar of Poitiers (d. c. 1120), the letters of Cassiodorus and the letters of magister Stephan. Stephen of Tournai (1128-1203) was master of Saint-Geneviève in Paris, where Abelard had also taught.

The anonymous author emphasized the importance of logic to formulate one’s thoughts cogently, persuasively and  elegantly. (Leclerq, L’amitié, p. 393) At the end of the codex is a formulary (ff. 172-177v ) providing more examples of good Latin style. The examples are taken from letters written by students from different schools in Paris.

Petrarch, who acquired the codex after 1337, added notes, dots and pointing hands throughout the manuscript. He was particularly interested in the letters of Abelard and Heloise. Their letters received the most extensive comments.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Petrarch added appreciative remarks on their style of writing. On f. 16r, next to Heloise’s first letter to Abelard (Letter II in the collection) he wrote: </p><p>“Amicissime et eleganter”<br />“Most lovingly and elegant” </p><p>A few lines below we see a sign resembling a flower, consisting of four dots with a flourish. This was one of Petrarch’s favourite signs to mark a passage worthy of note.

On f. 22v, in the margin of Abelard’s reply to Heloise (letter V), he address Abelard directly: “Non ineleganter ais, petre”; “You have said this quite elegantly, Peter.”</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[2923f22v.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Not every word or action of Abelard met with Petrarch’s approval. He criticized Abelard, for example, for dragging Heloise down with him. Next to a passage in a letter where Heloise wrote that it was not devotion that brought her to the monastery, but “an unfortunate love and a cruel relation”, Petrarch writes: “… quo post te demum vel invita traheretur Heloysa tua, Petre”; “… in the end your Heloise was hauled here after you against her will, Peter” (f. 24r)</p><p>±col2±</p><p>Heloise, by contrast, received nothing but praise. Petrarch expressed his admiration for her, as if she were standing right before him: “Valde perdulciter ac blande per totum agis, Heloysa”; “Truly you act most sweetly and persuasively in everything, Heloise” (f. 15r). The remark is accompanied by a pointing hand and his characteristic attention sign in the shape of a flower. It is evident that Petrarch’s regard for Heloise went beyond a mere appreciation of her rhetorical style and extended to her demeanor and stance in life. </p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[2923f15r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Was it Petrarch, who rubbed away Heloise’s face from the opening initial of this codex? If so, his touching of Heloise’s face will not have been a gesture of rejection, but rather of admiration.   </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[2923f1r.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>In 1362 Petrarch donated many, but not all, of his manuscripts to the Republic of Venice. The codex that is now Paris, BnF, lat. 2923, appears to have been one of the manuscripts he kept in his possession. This may be taken as evidence, together with the notes he added to the manuscript, that Petrarch was not only interested in classical texts, but also in medieval epistolary compositions, which provided him with examples of admirable rhetorical style. </p><p>±col2±</p><p>After his death in 1374, the remaining manuscripts were dispersed throughout Europe. Codex Paris, BnF, lat. 2923 found its way to the library of the dukes of Milan, where it is mentioned in a catalogue of 1426. After 1501 it ended up in the Bibliothèque royale de Blois, the library of Louis XII (r. 1498-1515). On one of the flyleafs, f. IIr, is a shelfmark of that library: ‘tab 7 xiiii’.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[2923fIIr.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Petrarch used the end leafs of the codex to keep tabs on his struggles with sexual temptation. He used a code of dots, dashes and crosses to mark specific nights and days between the years 1344 and 1349.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The code has not been deciphered yet. But exclamations such as ‘heu heu’ (encircled in red) suggest that Petrarch’s fight against temptations was not entirely successful. </p><p>±col2span±</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf292_178_v }}<p>±row±</p><p>±col1span±</p><p>Sources used for this contribution:</p><ul><li>Leclerq, Jean, 'l'amitié dans les letters au Moyen age', <em>Revue du Moyen Age Latin</em> 1 (1945), pp. 391–410</li><li>Luscombe, David (ed.), <em>The Letter Collection of Abelard and Heloise</em>, translated by Betty Radice and revised by David Luscombe (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013)</li><li>Mews, Constant J., ‘Interpreting Abelard and Heloise in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.
