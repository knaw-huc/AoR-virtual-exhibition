In 999 he became Pope, taking the name Sylvester II. He died in 1003. Gerbert is also an influential figure in the history of medieval science. During a period in Spain he was influenced by advanced Arabic mathematics, and on his return to the the north of France introduced the abacus, a counting device.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[scaliger.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Intellectual networks</h2><p>Gerbert became head of the cathedral school in Reims in 972 while Abbo taught at the monastic school of Fleury prior to his elevation to abbot in 988. Thanks to their powerful ecclesiastical positions, they built up networks of political and intellectual acquaintances, useful sources for obtaining manuscripts of rare texts. Gerbert, for example, wrote to Constantine, <em>scolasticus</em> or schoolmaster at Fleury, requesting works of Cicero, such as the <em>Republic</em> and the <em>Verrine Orations</em>.

Aimoin emphasises Abbo’s well-rounded education. He was trained in grammar, arithmetic and dialectic at Fleury as a child, before going to Paris and Reims, where he learned philosophy (’<em>philosophia</em>’, presumably advanced logic) and astronomy. He then travelled to his homeplace, Orleans, where he studied music.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>As Aimoin points out, Abbo was then well-versed in five out of the seven liberal arts, but taught himself rhetoric and geometry. Aimoin comments that Abbo read ‘Victorinus’, the fourth-century author of a commentary on Cicero’s <em>De inventione.</em> [link to copy of Victorinus in Gerard d’Abbeville presentation]</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[71852.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><p>Abbo and Dialectic<br />Abbo wrote a number of dialectical treatises influenced by the corpus of works included in the <em>logica vetus, </em>including translations of Aristotle. He made use of diagrams and tables to illustrate and explain his works, many of which were copied by his fellow monks in the scriptorium in Fleury.

In his <em>Historia </em>(III.46)<em>, </em>the chronicler Richer of Saint-Remi describes the texts which Gerbert used to teach dialectic: Porphyry’s <em>Isagoge </em>with Boethius’s commentary, along with translations of Aristotle’s <em>Categories</em> and <em>Periermenias, </em>and Cicero’s <em>Topica, </em>again with Boethius’s six-book commentary. Richer continues (III.47) to list Boethius’s other works, including <em>De topicis differentiis </em>and his works on syllogisms.</p><p>±col2±</p><p>As well as providing a list of titles, Richer also offers a few biographical details about their authors. He notes that Boethius’s commentary on the <em>Isagoge </em>depended on a translation of the text by the rhetorician Marius Victorinus. He comments that Cicero’s <em>Topica</em> was translated by ‘Tullius’ from Greek into Latin, and adds that Boethius, who he refers to as ‘Manilius’ was a consul (an important political role in the Ostrogothic kingdom). These details underscored the authorities of their authors.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[nal1478.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Gerbert’s Curriculum: Rhetoric</h2><p>Richer also (<em>Historia</em> III.47) also describes Gerbert’s rhetorical curriculum. To learn the art of eloquence, students read the Latin poets Virgil, Statius and Terence along with the satirical works of Juvenal, Persius and Horace. In addition, they read Lucan’s histories – presumably the <em>Pharsalia</em>, a lengthy epic poem. Richer emphasises that Gerbert’s rhetorical curriculum didn’t depend on rhetorical classics, such as Cicero’s <em>De inventione</em>, but on the practical study of rhetoric as applied in exemplary Latin works. </p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[nal14782.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Gerbert’s Curriculum in Practice</h2><p>Richer (III.48) offers a further insight to Gerbert’s practice-driven curriculum. ‘After they had been instructed in this art [rhetoric], he brought in a sophist with whom they practised <em>controversiae</em>,  and they conducted themselves in such a way that they seemed to act without any art at all, which is the greatest achievement for an orator.’<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Gerbert’s students practiced rhetorical and dialectical argumentation, using what they had learned from the corpus of ancient texts.</p><p>±col2span±</p><p>[[[7740.jpg]]]</p><p>±row±</p><p>±col1±</p><h2>Gerbert and Abbo: Friends or Foes?</h2><p>Gerbert and Abbo were leading intellectual figures of their day, but they seem to have had little to no contact. Were they rivals? The silence of the sources might suggest so. In 980 Gerbert wrote a letter to Constantine, monk of Fleury,  introducing his writings on the abacus. In this letter he criticised a ’half-educated philosopher’ who ‘really still a learner along with me’, ‘pretends that only he has knowledge of it, as Horace says’ [adapted from H. P. Lattin (trans.) <em>The Letters of Gerbert </em>(Columbia, 1961), p. 45].</p><p>±col2±</p><p>This ‘half-educated philosopher’ has often been presumed to be Abbo, but in truth Gerbert could have been criticising anyone who prized the appearance of knowledge over its possession.  In quoting from Horace (Letters II.I.87), Gerbert is also showing off his classical knowledge to Constantine, and so playing an intellectual game which we cannot necessarily over-interpret.</p><p>±col3±</p><p>[[[vlq33.jpg]]]</p><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p> (translated in J.
