<h2><em>Categoriae Decem</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup></h2><p>The <em>Categoriae Decem</em> (“Ten Categories”) is a late fourth-century Latin summary of Aristotle’s <a href="/text-portraits.html?portait=Aristotle1"><em>Categories</em></a><em>. </em>In the entire Middle Ages it was attributed to Augustine, which surely contributed greatly to its popularity and authority. Together with <a href="file:///C:\text-portraits.html?portait=Boethius2">Boethius’</a> translation and commentary of the <em>Categories</em>, this Pseudo-Augustinian version became the main text used for dealing with the Aristotelian <em>Categories</em> since the sixth century.</p><p>[[[decem.jpg]]]</p><p>The <em>Categoriae Decem </em>was indeed the principal source through which scholars gained their knowledge of the <em>Categories</em>. The text contains an introductory section which discusses the distinction between words, which signify, and things, which are signified. In the second section Aristotle’s classification of logical terms under ten categories is treated. Furthermore it treats the crucial definitions of ‘substance’ and ‘accident’: ‘substance’ is that which describes what something is (e.g. “Socrates is a man”) and ‘accidents’ are the properties of the substance which are not essential for its being (e.g. “Socrates is eating, Socrates walks through the streets”, etc.). These accidents are divided into ten categories. The text appeared as a summary of the Aristotelian work intermingled with commentary. It was this part of the text that mainly drew the attention of the early medieval scholars. When in the eleventh and twelfth centuries the interest in the more technical aspects of logic grew and new texts were found to satisfy that interest, the popularity of the Pseudo-Augustinian <em>Categoriae Decem</em> started to be eclipsed by Boethius’ version.</p><p>Source used for this contribution:</p><p>Studtmann, Paul, "Aristotle's Categories", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </em>(Fall 2018 Edition), Edward N.
