<h2>Aristotle’s <em>Prior</em> and <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, <em>Topics</em>, and <em>Sophistical Refutations</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup></h2><table><tr><td></td></tr></table><p>The <em>Organon </em>(“Instrument”) is the collection of Aristotle’s logical treatises. The works that deal with argumentation are the <em>Prior</em> and <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, <em>Topics</em> and <em>Sophistical Refutations</em>. The <em>Prior Analytics</em> contain the doctrine of the <a href="/syllogism#syllogism">syllogism</a>, which is, in essence, a logical argument made up of three parts: two premises and a conclusion (if all men are mortal, and if Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal). In the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> Aristotle applied the theory of syllogism to reach “scientific demonstration”, to establish scientific truths. This work was not among the Aristotelian works that Boethius translated into Latin and came to the West in the twelfth century. </p><p> [[[posterior.jpg]]]</p><p>The <em>Topica</em> demonstrates how to construct arguments. It lists some hundred <em>topoi</em>: for example, if a predicate is generally true of a <em>genus</em> (e.g. living things), then the predicate is also true of any <em>species</em> (e.g. plants) of that <em>genus</em>. Thus: “if the capacity of nutrition belongs to all living things, then the capacity of nutrition belongs to plants”, since plants are living things. They are useful to construct dialectical arguments, and with them the dialectician should be able to formulate deductions on any problem he could be proposed. The aim of the <em>Topics</em> was to teach the questioner and the answerer how to sustain their parts in a dialectical discussion (a debate or disputation); they were described by Aristotle as the starting point for attacking the theses of the opponents.<br /></p><p>The <em>Sophistical Refutations</em>, considered as the final section of the <em>Topica</em>, discuss fallacious arguments, that is, those which <em>appear</em> logical but of which the reasoning is <em>invalid</em>. The text is concerned with the tactics for the questioner and for the answerer and show how to detect weaknesses in the arguments of the other. These three works had a great influence on the study of logic in the Middle Ages and were particularly useful for the university practice of public disputations.</p><p>Sources used for this contribution:</p><p>Smith, Robin, "Aristotle’s Logic", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Fall 2020 Edition), Edward N.
