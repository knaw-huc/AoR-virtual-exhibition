<p><strong>The medieval classroom</strong></p><p><strong>The classroom:</strong></p><p>In the medieval Latin world, teaching and learning were firmly in the domain of the church. To learn how to read and write meant to learn Latin, and Latin was the language of the bible and the liturgy. In the earlier middle ages, monasteries were the most important institutions for learning and teaching, and also for the production of books. In the later middle ages, courts, cities and institutions such as universities also became prime book producers.</p><p>[[[classroom.jpg]]]</p><p><strong>The classroom: study books</strong></p><p>Introduction text</p><p>Meet three different types of books that were used by students</p><p>±f±bnf129_plat sup._±f±</p>{{> folios/folio-bpl144_cover_ }}<p>±f±bnf178_plat supérieur_±f±</p><p><strong>Paris, BnF, lat. 12949</strong></p><p>Main text</p>{{> folios/folio-bnf129_25_v }}<p>±p±57±p±</p><p>±a±2ho±a±</p><p>±p±58±p±</p><p><strong>Leiden, BPL 144</strong></p><p>Main text</p><p>±f±bpl144_2_r±f± Lay-out is such that enough marginal space is provided for commentary (70% of the page is margin!)</p><p>±f±bpl144_21_v±f± The material state of this manuscript is not great.
