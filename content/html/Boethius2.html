<h2>Boethius’ translations and commentaries on logic<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </h2><table><tr><td></td></tr></table><p>Boethius (ca 475/7 CE – 524/26 CE) was a Roman philosopher who had a thorough, Greek education. He spent most of his life pursuing the ambition to translate the Greek learning of his time into Latin. His translations and commentaries on logic were key for the transmission of Aristotelian logic to medieval logicians. The surviving works are: <em>De divisione </em>(“On division”), <em>De syllogismo cathegorico</em> (“On categorical syllogism”), <em>Introductio ad syllogismos cathegoricos</em> (“Introduction to categorical syllogisms”), <em>De hypotheticis syllogismis</em> (“On hypothetical syllogisms”), and<em> De topicis differentiis</em> (“On topical differences”). These texts offer a clear presentation of the Aristotelian doctrine in logic. They are thoroughly didactical in nature: they are student guide-books in how to master the art of reasoning.</p><p> [[[philosophers.jpg]]]</p><p><em>De divisione</em> is a study about the various ways to divide things. There are two types of division: intrinsic (<em>per se</em>) and accidental (<em>per accidens</em>). Intrinsic division can be of a <em>genus</em> into its <em>species</em>, of a <em>whole</em> into <em>parts</em>, and of a <em>word</em> into its <em>different meanings</em>. For example, a substance can be divided into corporeal (e.g. body) and incorporeal (e.g. soul) substances, and corporeal substances can be divided into animate (e.g. horse) and inanimate (e.g. stone).  Accidental division can be of a subject into accidents (e.g. of all men, some have brown eyes, some blue, some brown), of an accident into subjects (e.g. some things are found in the soul, some in bodies), and of an accident into accidents (e.g. of all animate things some are hard, some are soft).</p><p><em>De syllogismo cathegorico</em> is a basic handbook for understanding syllogisms in two books. In the <em>Introductio ad syllogismos cathegoricos</em> the first book is discussed in more detail. The key words for understanding these works are propositions and syllogisms, which provided a methodology for constructing a logical argument. A proposition is a subject and predicate linked with a verb (e.g. all cats are animals); a syllogism is a type of argument consisting of two premises (propositions) which lead to a conclusion. [link syllogism]</p><p><em>De hypotheticis syllogismis</em> introduces the general theory of hypothetical syllogisms: those in which one or more premises are hypothetical sentences. While a categorical sentence makes a predication (e.g. Plato is a philosopher), a hypothetical sentence involves a condition (e.g. <em>if</em> it is day, it is light).</p><p>It is largely due to Boethius that in the Middle Ages the <em>Topica</em> of Aristotle and Cicero were revived [link Aristotle2; link Cicero]. His tradition of topical argumentation was influential throughout the Middle Ages and into the early Renaissance. <em>De topicis differentiis</em> (“On topical differences”) is a treatise in four books on topical argumentation, which is an argumentation based on so-called <em>topoi</em> or <em>loci</em>. It is concerned with the discovery of arguments; the instrument for doing so is a topic, a place which the memoriser pictures in his mind and from which he recalls what he wants to remember. The memoriser familiarizes himself with, for instance, objects in a room, and fixes them in his memory in a certain order. He then divides his speech into parts and each object is associated with a part of the speech. The method can change depending on the use, for legal or political speeches or in dialectic for philosophical and theological inquiry. </p><p>Source used for this contribution:</p><p>Marenbon, John, "Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N.
